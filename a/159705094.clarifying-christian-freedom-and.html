Questions naturally arise concerning which of these ancient commands still hold significance, why certain practices seem to have been set aside, and what the overarching purpose of this extensive body of law is for those living under the New Covenant. This exploration can sometimes lead to uncertainty, a tendency towards legalism, or even a complete disregard for the Old Testament, which risks losing valuable insights into God's character and His comprehensive plan for humanity.</p><p>This report aims to clarify that while salvation is attained solely through faith in Jesus Christ, and not by adhering to the Old Testament Law, these sacred texts are far from obsolete for Christians. Believers are permitted and can indeed discover profound spiritual enrichment by voluntarily embracing certain aspects of the Law as an expression of their love for God and their aspiration to align their lives with His divine principles. This voluntary adherence should be born from a heart transformed by grace, motivated by a deep affection for God, rather than from a sense of duty aimed at earning salvation.</p><p>The Apostle Paul, in his letter to the Romans, delves into the nature and purpose of the Law. In Romans 7:12, it is unequivocally stated, "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good" <sup>1</sup>. This declaration underscores the inherent goodness of the Law, reflecting the very holiness and righteousness of God. The Law, being of divine origin, is not inherently flawed. Instead, it functions as a perfect standard, revealing the sinfulness of humanity and our innate inability to meet God's perfect requirements through our own strength <sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Paul himself grappled with the Law, as vividly portrayed in Romans 7:14-25. Scholars have debated whether this passage describes Paul's experience before or after his conversion <sup>6</sup>. Regardless of the specific timing, this account powerfully illustrates the internal struggle experienced even by those who genuinely desire to do good, a conflict arising from the pervasive power of sin <sup>8</sup>. As explained in Romans 7:1, the Law's authority extends only to the living. Through union with Christ, believers have died to the Law as a system for achieving righteousness before God <sup>10</sup>. The concept of "sin" as a force residing within human nature, as discussed, utilizes the Law as a platform to manifest its influence, even when an individual intends to obey God's commands <sup>9</sup>. This highlights the Law's role in exposing the profound depth of sin.</p><p>A critical point emphasized is that Paul's intention in Romans 7 is not to denigrate the Law but to defend it against the misconception that he was dismissing its value <sup>8</sup>. His central argument is that while the Law is indeed good, it lacks the power to enable obedience. That power is found in the Holy Spirit, a topic explored further in Romans 8. The Law serves as God's personal voice, a voice with which Paul wholeheartedly concurs <sup>8</sup>. Therefore, the primary function of the Law, as presented in Romans 7, is not to provide a pathway to salvation but to reveal sin and underscore humanity's dependence on something beyond itself to attain righteousness. Paul's personal struggle exemplifies the universal human experience of falling short of God's perfect standards through mere willpower. The Law, in its holiness and goodness, paradoxically becomes the very means through which the exceeding sinfulness of sin is revealed <sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Romans 8 offers the resolution to the struggle depicted in Romans 7, presenting the liberation and new life accessible through Jesus Christ and the indwelling Holy Spirit. Romans 8:2 declares, "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death" <sup>11</sup>. The "law of the Spirit of life" refers to the power of the Holy Spirit at work within believers, contrasting with the "law of sin and death," which symbolizes the condemnation and powerlessness of the Law to conquer sin <sup>12</sup>. Romans 8:1 provides a foundational truth: "Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" <sup>14</sup>. This establishes the fundamental freedom from the Law's judgment for all who are united with Christ. The "Zoe" life, intrinsically linked to the Spirit, stands in stark contrast to the death associated with the flesh and soul. Embracing the Spirit's control places believers under the dominion of this "law of the Spirit of life" <sup>15</sup>.</p><p>The Holy Spirit plays a vital role in the lives of believers <sup>16</sup>. Every believer is indwelt by the Holy Spirit, who empowers them to live righteously, overcoming the limitations experienced in Romans 7 <sup>17</sup>. The Spirit is a divine gift, a Helper, Comforter, and Guide who leads believers into truth and strengthens their faith in Christ <sup>16</sup>. Furthermore, the Spirit intercedes for believers in their moments of weakness, even with expressions that transcend human language <sup>19</sup>. Romans 8 highlights several key aspects of the Holy Spirit's work: being the "Spirit of life," opposing the desires of the flesh, identifying those who belong to God, and enabling them to overcome sinful desires <sup>20</sup>. The freedom from the Law described in Romans 8 is not an invitation to licentiousness but a liberation from its condemnation and the inherent inability of human effort to fully satisfy its demands. The Holy Spirit actively empowers believers to live lives that align with God's will, fulfilling the righteous requirements of the Law in a manner that the Law itself could not achieve <sup>11</sup>. The indwelling Spirit offers both the power and the guidance necessary for a transformed life, moving beyond mere external compliance to an internal yearning for righteousness.</p><p>The letter to the Galatians further clarifies the relationship between faith and the Law, particularly in the context of how one is made right with God. In Galatians 3, Paul addresses churches that were being influenced by those who insisted on the necessity of following Jewish Law, such as circumcision, for salvation. Galatians 3:11 plainly states, "Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because, 'The righteous will live by faith'" <sup>21</sup>. This emphasizes the principle of justification through faith alone, independent of any works prescribed by the Law <sup>21</sup>. Various translations of Galatians 3:11 reinforce this central truth <sup>22</sup>. Galatians 3:12 further clarifies, "The law, however, is not based on faith; on the contrary, 'The man who does these things will live by them'" <sup>23</sup>. This highlights the fundamental difference between the principle of law, which operates on a works-based system, and the principle of faith. The Law, in essence, was about actions intended to demonstrate the need for faith, and ultimately, no one can achieve righteousness in God's eyes through their own adherence to the Law <sup>25</sup>.</p><p>Galatians also explains the role of the Law as a "tutor" or "guardian" <sup>26</sup>. The Law served to guide and protect people until the coming of Christ, revealing their sinfulness and their inability to save themselves <sup>27</sup>. This role was temporary, preparing people for faith in Jesus Christ. Once faith in Christ has come, believers are no longer under the authority of this tutor <sup>26</sup>. Just as a child needs a tutor until they reach maturity, the Law served a similar function in God's plan <sup>21</sup>. Therefore, justification, being declared righteous in God's sight, is based solely on faith in Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice, not on human efforts to keep the Law. The Law served a specific, temporary purpose: to reveal sin and direct humanity towards its need for a Savior. With Christ's arrival and the provision of salvation through faith, the Law's role as a means of justification came to an end. In its function as a tutor, the Law was ultimately beneficial, guiding people to Christ. This suggests that even though it does not bring salvation, it plays a vital part in God's redemptive story.</p><p>In Galatians 5, Paul addresses the practical implications of being justified by faith and liberated from the obligation of the Law for salvation, emphasizing the concept of Christian liberty. Galatians 5:1 declares, "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not be encumbered once more by a yoke of slavery" <sup>31</sup>. This freedom signifies liberation from the bondage of legalism, the belief that one can earn or maintain salvation through adherence to the Law <sup>31</sup>. Believers are encouraged to stand firm in Christ's completed work and not revert to relying on their own good deeds <sup>33</sup>. This liberty, however, is not a license to indulge in sin but a calling to serve one another through love <sup>31</sup>. As stated in Galatians 5:13, "You, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another" <sup>31</sup>. True Christian freedom means being free from sin's guilt and penalty so that one can minister to others through love <sup>36</sup>.</p><p>Galatians 5:14 further explains, "For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself'" <sup>37</sup>. Love is presented as the essence and fulfillment of the Law within the new covenant <sup>37</sup>. This echoes Jesus' own summary of the Law. Love is not merely one commandment among many; it is the overarching principle that embodies the spirit of God's Law in the new covenant. By genuinely loving our neighbor as ourselves, we are essentially living out the intent behind all the commandments concerning human interaction. Christian liberty is a precious gift secured by Christ, freeing believers from the burden of attempting to earn God's favor through legalistic obedience. This freedom should inspire a life of love and service towards others, not self-indulgence. Love is the foundational principle that encapsulates the spirit of God's Law in the new covenant.</p><p>The Epistle of James offers practical guidance on living out one's faith, introducing the concept of the "perfect law of liberty." James 1:25 states, "But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do" <sup>41</sup>. This "perfect law of liberty" is often understood as the gospel of Jesus Christ or the entirety of God's Word that brings liberation from sin and death <sup>41</sup>. It is suggested that James is not referring to the Law of Moses but to living out faith in Christ, the law of love <sup>43</sup>. This "law of liberty" is linked to the freedom found in Christ as mentioned in Galatians <sup>44</sup>.</p><p>This concept is directly connected to the call to be doers of the word, and not merely hearers <sup>47</sup>. Simply hearing God's Word without acting upon it is a form of self-deception <sup>47</sup>. True reception of God's Word leads to obedience, which serves as evidence of genuine faith <sup>50</sup>. Using the analogy of a mirror, James suggests that we must not only recognize our imperfections in God's Word but also actively work to correct them <sup>46</sup>. The freedom offered by the gospel is not passive; it demands active engagement with God's Word and a commitment to living according to its principles. True faith is demonstrated through obedience. Knowing the Law or the gospel alone is insufficient; it must manifest in action and a transformed life. The "perfect law of liberty" can be understood as the guiding principles of the Christian life, found in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, which, when followed, lead to genuine freedom and blessing.</p><p>The Old Testament Psalms offer a valuable perspective on the Law, portraying it as something to be delighted in and meditated upon, even by those who were under its obligation. Psalm 1:1-2 states, "Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked...but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night" <sup>52</sup>. This highlights the blessedness associated with finding joy and satisfaction in God's Law, whether it refers to the Torah or the broader teachings of God <sup>52</sup>. "Meditation" in this context implies a deep, continuous reflection and internalization of God's Word <sup>53</sup>. The "law of the Lord" could refer to the Pentateuch or even the Psalter itself, emphasizing the importance of engaging with God's Word <sup>55</sup>. Psalm 37:4 encourages, "Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart" <sup>57</sup>. Delighting in the Lord involves finding peace and fulfillment in Him, which can lead to our desires aligning with His will <sup>60</sup>. This delight is connected to joy in His word and worship <sup>59</sup>.</p><p>Psalm 119 is an extensive meditation on the value and beauty of God's Law, encompassing instructions, precepts, and statutes <sup>63</sup>. The psalmist expresses a deep love, longing, and delight in God's Law <sup>65</sup>. For the psalmist, the Law was not a burden but a source of wisdom, guidance, comfort, and joy <sup>66</sup>. The giving of the Law was viewed as an act of God's goodness, love, and grace <sup>66</sup>. The term "law" here can refer to the entire revelation of truth in God's Word <sup>67</sup>. Even within the Old Covenant, the ideal relationship with God's Law involved a heart of delight and a desire for deeper understanding and obedience, not just mere compliance. These Psalms demonstrate that God's commands are not intended to be viewed solely as obligations but can be a source of profound joy and spiritual nourishment for those who love God. For Christians today, these Psalms encourage a similar attitude towards God's Word – to approach it with a heart of love, finding delight in its wisdom and allowing it to shape our lives.</p><p><strong>In synthesizing these passages, it becomes clear that while Christians are freed from the obligation of the Old Testament Law for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, the moral principles within the Law still reflect God's character and offer valuable guidance for Christian living. Keeping aspects of the Old Testament Law can be a voluntary expression of love and devotion to God, motivated by a transformed heart empowered by the Holy Spirit, aimed at reflecting Christ's love, rather than a legalistic attempt to earn favor.</strong></p><p>There is a crucial distinction between approaching the Law out of obligation for salvation and voluntarily adhering to its principles out of love and devotion. The New Covenant, established through Jesus Christ, is based on grace through faith, not on works of the Law. Attempting to be justified by the Law after Christ misunderstands and even rejects the sufficiency of His sacrifice. God's commandments, in both the Old and New Testaments, were given out of love for humanity. The Law in the Old Testament served to guide a specific covenant people and reveal God's standards. The commands in the New Testament, particularly the emphasis on love, build upon this foundation, reflecting God's ongoing desire for our well-being and our relationship with Him. Consider the Ten Commandments: while Christians are not under the Old Covenant, the moral principles within them (e.g., do not murder, steal, lie) remain relevant and reflect God's unchanging character. Observing these out of love for God and neighbor is fundamentally different from observing them to earn salvation.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>The moral principles of the Law remain valuable and can be voluntarily observed out of love for God and neighbor. </p></div><p><strong>Feature</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Old: </strong>Old Covenant Law</p></li><li><p><strong>New: </strong>New Covenant in Christ</p></li></ul><p><strong>Basis</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Old: </strong>Works of the Law, Obedience to Commandments</p></li><li><p><strong>New: </strong>Grace through Faith in Jesus Christ</p></li></ul><p><strong>Goal</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Old: </strong>Righteousness before God (unattainable by human effort)</p></li><li><p><strong>New: </strong>Justification and Sanctification by God's grace</p></li></ul><p><strong>Scope</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Old: </strong>Comprehensive set of laws (moral, ceremonial, judicial)</p></li><li><p><strong>New: </strong>Primarily focused on the "law of love" (love God and neighbor)</p></li></ul><p><strong>Motivation</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Old: </strong>Obligation, fear of punishment, desire for blessing</p></li><li><p><strong>New: </strong>Love for God, gratitude for salvation, desire to please Him</p></li></ul><p><strong>Power for Obedience</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Old: </strong>External commands, human effort</p></li><li><p><strong>New: </strong>Indwelling Holy Spirit</p></li></ul><p><strong>Outcome</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Old: </strong>Condemnation for failure to perfectly obey</p></li><li><p><strong>New: </strong>Forgiveness, new life, eternal salvation</p></li></ul><p><strong>Relevance Today</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Old: </strong>Moral principles still reflect God's character</p></li><li><p><strong>New: </strong>Foundation of Christian life and relationship with God</p></li></ul><p>In conclusion, followers of Christ are freed from the obligation of the Old Testament Law for salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. However, the moral principles of the Law remain valuable and can be voluntarily observed out of love for God and neighbor. It is important to approach God's entire Word with a heart of love and a desire to understand God's character and principles, guided by the Holy Spirit who empowers believers to live righteously and to fulfill the spirit of the Law through love. The focus should be on a heart-motivated obedience that flows from gratitude for God's grace in Christ, rather than a legalistic adherence aimed at earning divine favor. May we all walk in love, guided by God's Word, living out our faith in a way that honors God and blesses those around us.</p><h4><strong>Works cited</strong></h4><ol><li><p>Romans 7:12-14 KJV - Wherefore the law is holy, and the - Bible Gateway, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7:12-14&amp;version=KJV">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207%3A12-14&amp;version=KJV</a></p></li><li><p>Romans 7:12-13 KJV - Bible.com, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ROM.7.12-13.KJV">https://www.bible.com/bible/1/ROM.7.12-13.KJV</a></p></li><li><p>What does Romans 7:12 mean? - BibleRef.com, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/7/Romans-7-12.html">https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/7/Romans-7-12.html</a></p></li><li><p>Romans 7:12 - So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is h... - Bible Study Tools, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.biblestudytools.com/romans/7-12.html">https://www.biblestudytools.com/romans/7-12.html</a></p></li><li><p>Romans 7:12 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good. - Bible Hub, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm</a></p></li><li><p>Does Romans 7 Describe a Christian? | Desiring God, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/does-romans-7-describe-a-christian">https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/does-romans-7-describe-a-christian</a></p></li><li><p>Does Romans 7 Describe a Believer or Unbeliever? - Theology in the raw, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://theologyintheraw.com/does-romans-7-describe-a-believer-or-unbeliever/">https://theologyintheraw.com/does-romans-7-describe-a-believer-or-unbeliever/</a></p></li><li><p>What's Really Going On in Romans 7 - The Gospel Coalition, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/romans-7-apostle-paul-confession/">https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/romans-7-apostle-paul-confession/</a></p></li><li><p>The Truth About Romans 7 - Matt McMillen, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://mattmcmillenministries.com/the-truth-about-romans-7/">https://mattmcmillenministries.com/the-truth-about-romans-7/</a></p></li><li><p>Enduring Word Bible Commentary Romans Chapter 7, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/romans-7/">https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/romans-7/</a></p></li><li><p>Romans 8 LEB - Set Free from the Law of Sin and Death - Bible Gateway, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8&amp;version=LEB">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208&amp;version=LEB</a></p></li><li><p>Romans 8:2 For in Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set you free from the law of sin and death. - Bible Hub, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm">https://biblehub.com/romans/8-2.htm</a></p></li><li><p>What is the law of the Spirit of life (Romans 8:2)? | GotQuestions.org, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/law-of-the-Spirit-of-life.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/law-of-the-Spirit-of-life.html</a></p></li><li><p>Romans 8 NIV - Life Through the Spirit - Therefore, - Bible Gateway, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8&amp;version=NIV">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208&amp;version=NIV</a></p></li><li><p>The Law of the Spirit of Life: Romans 8:2 - GoServ Global, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://goservglobal.org/2024/02/15/the-law-of-the-spirit-of-life-romans-82/">https://goservglobal.org/2024/02/15/the-law-of-the-spirit-of-life-romans-82/</a></p></li><li><p>Commentary on Romans 8:14-17 - Working Preacher from Luther Seminary, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.workingpreacher.org/commentaries/revised-common-lectionary/day-of-pentecost-3/commentary-on-romans-814-17-3">https://www.workingpreacher.org/commentaries/revised-common-lectionary/day-of-pentecost-3/commentary-on-romans-814-17-3</a></p></li><li><p>Romans 8 - OAKRIDGE BIBLE CHAPEL, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://oakridgebiblechapel.org/romans-8/">https://oakridgebiblechapel.org/romans-8/</a></p></li><li><p>What is the role of the Holy Spirit in our lives today? | GotQuestions.org, accessed March 23, 2025, <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/Spirit-today.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/Spirit-today.html</a></p></li><li><p>Romans 8:26 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
