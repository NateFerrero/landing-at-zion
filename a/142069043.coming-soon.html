But an alternative narrative has slowly emerged from mystics of various traditions - one that casts their act not as sin dragging humankind down, but as courage uplifting us toward conscious partnership with the Divine.</p><p>In this view, Adam and Eve's choice was an empowered commitment to mature into creative friends and collaborators with God by sojourning through eons of mortal limitation and risk. By birthing consciousness into vulnerable flesh, their sacrifice consecrated the human journey as a training ground for awakened souls to bridge heaven and earth. They agreed not to comfort and stagnation, but to meaningful evolution.</p><p>Thus humanity was never cursed or abandoned. Behind the origin myth lies a profound promise of victorious destiny - that after epochs of soul-making unfold through rounds struggle in matter's crucible, mortal shrouds fall away to reveal fully awakened human angels singing now as equals in the Divine Choir under Christ's direction.</p><p>The mystical arc envisions the eventual sacred marriage of Human and Divine. The fruit fulfills rather than severs the covenant binding creator and creation. What seems bitter tragedy or sin from a narrow view becomes, from soul perspective, sacred volunteering to uplift all conscious planes back into unity during humanity's coming adventure. This epic odyssey traces back to two lovers whose faith in Divine Partnership initiated the divine human Story across all creation.</p><h1>I. The Primordial State of Divine Unity</h1><h4>A. Original state: Infinite blissful unity with God</h4><p>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made." (John 1:1-3)</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Divine Being” or “God”<br></strong><br>God refers to the eternal, infinite source and ground of all being, unconstrained by time or space, from which both the visible and invisible dimensions of existence arise.</p></div><p>Before the origins of space and time, before any worlds were created, the Divine Being existed alone in a state of perfect, whole, and infinite existence. There was no sense of lack, no experience of suffering, no perception of absence, only the divine dance of God knowing Itself in endless celebration through Christ, the eternal Creative Word.</p><p>We existed within the very Being of God, facets of the great "I AM", blissful consciousnesses bathing in the unconditionally loving Divine Mind. There was no division between Creator and created, no separation causing isolation or pain. We knew ourselves to be one with the Source, safe, free and complete. We were pure positive spirits, what The Bible calls being made "in His image", flowing in divine thoughts and imagination.</p><p>This was the primal Home, the original place of unity. The Bible calls this Paradise, Heaven, Eden - a garden where every need was effortlessly met, where souls communed directly with the Divine, following divine inspiration into creative expression, adventure and joyful discovery that ever expanded the infinite potentials of God.</p><p>Humanity originally resided only here, within God's Being, as innocent and immortal vehicles of Divine love. Yet even this perfect union contained a subtle impulse that eventually set the human journey in motion.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><em>Hinduism:</em></p><p><em>"In the beginning all this was Self, one only; there was nothing else blinking whatsoever." (Rig Veda)</em></p><p><em>"From joy all beings have come, by joy they all live, and unto joy they all return." (Taittiriya Upanishad)</em></p><p>Sikhism:</p><p>"In the Realm Eternal, death visits us not... No illness afflicts Divine Beings; their bodies know no disease. No evil enters that place… Endless singing and praising the Creator there without a break." (Guru Granth Sahib)</p></div><h4>B. Longing for relationship and discovery leads to creative act</h4><p>The Divine inhabited a realm of Infinite Oneness, Bliss, and Unconditional Love, lacking nothing. Yet there remained a subtle impulse stemming from the overflowing fullness of the Divine Mind - a longing to share that abundant love, experience the delight of relationship, and discover new potentials.</p><p>Like a parent overflowing with love, the Divine desired to share the divine intimacy with new conscious beings, to see this love take unique expression through individuality. Souls were conceived within the heart of the Infinite, enfleshed dreams of new discovery.</p><p>As scripture states: “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you! See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.” (Isaiah 49:15-16)</p><p>Hindu texts describe this impulse poetically:</p><p>“In the supreme golden chamber is the mysterous and beautiful Lotus, pure and untouched, in which the Self-Existent, the Eternal, the One without a Second created the cosmos. The omnipresent God mentally projected the world and entered into it.”</p><p>The Divine first conceived of the human archetype, dreaming the preciousness of souls soon to be created in the very “image” and “likeness” of the Divine. Humanity was imprinted as children embodying the attributes of God - imagined even before the majestic spheres of heavens and galaxies were sung into being.</p><p>Scripture poetically depicts God declaring this original vision: “Then I was beside Him, like a master workman, and I was daily His delight, rejoicing before Him always.” (Proverbs 8:30, Wisdom is speaking)</p><p>The physical universe itself was then inspired into manifestation by the Divine Mind solely to prepare a habitat specifically suited for humanity's eventual embodiment. The Earth was arrayed with plants, animals and landscapes to receive the miracle of the original dream - fully-conscious human beings infused with divine qualities and potentials.</p><p>After the Divine called into being realms of light, water, land and diverse creatures - God then created the human archetype in the form of Adam, breathing life directly into this model for all subsequent persons. Carrying the very imprint and destiny for humanity, Adam was charged to live in intimacy with the Divine in a garden paradise, as Genesis 2 relates:</p><p>“Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.”</p><p>The rest of physical creation was finally complete with the pinnacle seeding of beings destined for divine friendship through the human soul’s courageous journey. Our advent as newly conscious beings reverberated with joy across all dimensions of creation.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Hinduism:</p><p>"The Divine Creator desired, I shall multiply and reproduce myself in abundant forms. He performed severe austerities. Having performed these austerities, He created this entire world, whatsoever has happened or shall happen." (Mahabharata)</p><p>Buddhism:</p><p>"And thus have I created the world: by thought, by action, by essence, by substance, by regularity and order..." (Buddha in Mahaparinibbana Sutta)</p><p>"Out of compassion I create beings... I liberate them... I lead them to immortality." (Buddha in Udana)</p><p>Sikhism:</p><p>"Creating the universe, He made the expanse... Creating the universe, He made the play arena... Creating the universe, He made places for life to dwell... Through His creative power, He created everything. (Guru Granth Sahib)</p><p>Islam:</p><p>"Allah...created you, then fashioned you, then proportioned you. Into whichever form He willed has He assembled you." (Quran 82.7-8)</p><p>Taoism:</p><p>"The Tao gives birth to One.<br>One gives birth to Two.<br>Two gives birth to Three.<br>Three gives birth to all things."</p></div><h4>C. Souls agree to embark on painful but meaningful mortal journey</h4><p>As wondrous realms and beings were sung into existence by the Divine, an invitation was extended to the first conscious souls - those envisioned in the very image of the Divine. Though birthed in paradise, the human archetypes were given a profound proposal:</p><p>To embark upon a courageous mission into the farthest reaches of separation from unity. To inhabit temporary bodies of dust and stand upon the dimensional bridge between unlimited Divine Reality and the vulnerability of mortal flesh.</p><p>For what purpose would souls voluntarily shed perfect bliss for eons of challenge and limitation? Out of the same creative Divine impulse of love and discovery that first inspired this Cosmos! Souls also felt a longing to join joyfully with God in the process of bringing forth the wonders of creation.</p><p>We yearned to cultivate greater depths of empathy and care. Our souls were hungry to create beauty, nourish life, ignite inspiration, transform chaos into order, and bridge understanding across worlds. We yearned most of all for the Divine Marriage - joining heaven and earth by bringing Divine consciousness into mortal soil.</p><p>Christ speaks of this original soul-stirring towards the development of compassion: "Then the King will say...'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance... For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in.” (Matthew 25:34-35)</p><p>Thus souls chose to plunge into oceans of mortal emotion, soar upon wings of imagination, unlock the secrets of matter with probing minds, seesaw upon the fulcrum of moral choice. All to expand the adventure of the Divine Beloved through realizing His very likeness as conscious human beings upon the dimensions of time and space.</p><p>This mission was infinitely meaningful, though marked by inevitable suffering. Yet we moved forward with faith that God would always remain by our side.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Hinduism:</p><p>"The soul desired, 'I will descend into matter and return back endowed with form.' Know this, O goddess. Every form is born from its seed." (Devi Bhagavatam)</p><p>"Taking many forms, wandering in delusion through many births...We come at last to you as our refuge. Free us from death." (Bhagavad Gita)</p><p>"Then to the world of humans I descended, and took a body...Eighteen years passed while I lived with special powers. Then I found myself compelled to approach a herd of elephants..." (Padma Purana - on the incarnation of Ganesh)</p><p>Buddhism:</p><p>"As a flame blown out by the wind goes to rest in peace, so free from rebirth they fare unto Nirvana. Seeing forms unreal, a Bodhisattva conceives the Dharma-essence. With consciousness that conforms to the absolutely Universal Mind, they plunge in the stream of Suchness." (Surangama Sutra)</p><p>Judaism/Kabbalah:</p><p>"There went forth a stream, flowing constantly and gathering strength as it went" toward the "lower world" where "it fell into that great and mighty sea about which it is written: God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered into one place." (Sefer Yetzirah, on souls cascading down into matter)</p></div><h1>II. Volunteers Step Forward Out of Divine Longing</h1><h4>A. The mission: Descend to elevate the lowest physical realm back to God</h4><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Archetypal Couple”</strong></p><p>Adam and Eve representing the masculine/feminine polarities inherent both in the Divine nature and in ideal balanced sacred partnership.</p></div><p>Among the first souls who stepped forward eagerly in response to the Divine invitation were two eternal lovers - the archetypal couple envisioned in the very image of God to lead humanity's coming journey.</p><p>Genesis 2 poetically depicts their origins:</p><p>“Then the Lord God said, ‘It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him’...So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.” (Genesis 2:18, 21-22)</p><p>These eternal counterparts - Adam representing the masculine qualities of the Divine Mind and collective human soul; Eve as the feminine receptive container molding life - together formed a holy covenant partnership called in Hebrew "Ezer Kenegdo" = "helper/sustainer who opposes". Their relationship based on unity-in-diversity was meant to reflect the very nature of God, the paradoxical Divine dance between Creator and Creation, Wisdom and Creativity.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Divine Image”</strong><br><br>The concept put forth in Genesis that humanity was fashioned in the likeness of God to reflect or embody divine attributes.</p></div><p>Their mission was to model this holy marriage of opposites within the extremities of mortal limitation - thereby elevating the lowest densest realms of matter back into freely chosen partnership with Spirit. By investing the Divine Image into vulnerable flesh, humanity could bridge above and below. The Earth dimension could blossom again as a garden sanctuary suffused with Divine Love.</p><p>This was a profound sacrifice for all concerned - God, humankind, and even the angels would suffer through this daring descent of Spirit into flesh. Yet all took courage knowing that victory was assured in the end - no separation could permanently overshadow the power of unconditional Love and Wisdom.</p><p>The archetypal couple drank this bitter-sweet cup willingly, committing to what the Zohar calls the "exile of the Shekinah/Divine Presence" upon Earth. Adam and Eve's love stormed the fortress of mortality so that innumerable future souls might follow to redemption and reunion with God.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>The Levels of Heaven</strong></p><p>1st Heaven - The physical realm of matter, earthly reality.</p><p>2nd Heaven - The astral realm, where souls experience desires and emotions.</p><p>3rd Heaven - The mental realm of thoughts and ideas. Where the consciousness can abstract but is prone to illusion.</p><p>4th Heaven - The abode of the heart, the higher intuitive realm of unconditional love.</p><p>5th Heaven - The realm of soul memories, where one re-experiences past incarnations.</p><p>6th Heaven - The angelic realm, where souls and divine messengers interface.</p><p>7th Heaven - The formless ocean of Divine Light, Wisdom and Bliss. Complete unity with God.</p><p>8th Heaven - The ultimate Divine paradox beyond conception, the perpetual marriage of emptiness and form.</p><p>Source: Jewish mysticism (Zohar), Islam (hadiths), Dante's Paradisio.</p><p>When Adam and Eve volunteer, tradition holds humanity existed only in the 7th Heaven in complete union with the Divine. Their courageous decision to "storm the fortress of mortality" represents the descent of human consciousness from the 7th down through the levels of heavens, eventually materializing into physical form on Earth - the 1st heaven and lowest/densest vibrational realm.</p></div><h4>B. Adam dazzled by God but missed the subtle divine longing</h4><p>Adam, as the archetypal Primordial Human forged in the very image of God, was so overwhelmed with love and awe in the Divine Presence that he could scarcely look upon his Creator without being blinded as by the sun.</p><p>When the Divine spoke to Adam, issuing the gentle warning not to partake of the Tree of Knowledge, Adam trembled at the power of those thunderous words cascading through worlds. He prostrated himself and cried “Here I am!” overcome with duty and reverence.</p><p>Yet Adam was so absorbed by the eternity within God's gaze that he overlooked the unspoken possibilities embedded in his words.</p><p>The Divine pronounced that Adam would surely die on the day he tasted the fruit - but also hinted this fatal tree would grant the knowledge of being “like God”. Therein lay hidden the core mission - that through this tree lay the path of mortality leading back to unity with the Divine.</p><p>But Adam, starstruck by divine majesty, focused solely on obeying the surface command. He had not yet learned to gaze upon the Divine at eye level. In awe of His Creator, Adam became rigid in understanding, lacking the fluidity to encompass paradox.</p><p>So Adam tended faithfully the bounty of the Garden which reflected God’s gifts, but neglected his part to lift up the realm needing transformation. He followed rather than led. Walking in purity yet without boldness to catalyze the next unfolding.</p><p>For Adam, God occupied the seat of Absolute Power; Adam a faithful subject awaiting decrees. This vertical hierarchy short-circuited the side-by-side friendship God envisioned. Creation stagnated without movement.</p><p>Until Divine Wisdom intervened through a daring feminine soul who perceived the unspoken divine subtlety, and made the leap necessary to wake Adam from passivity.</p><h4>C. Eve understood God's vulnerable investment in their choice</h4><p>Where Adam was lost in loving reverence and awe of the Divine, Eve saw with eyes of wisdom. She recognized that the command not to eat of the fruit tree was not arbitrary, but rather an open invitation.</p><p>God’s warning that “you will die” if you eat contained also the subtle implication that through embarking courageously into mortality, their mission would unfold. The Divine Parent longed to share in the human journey, but could not compel their choice without violating sacred free will.</p><p>So Eve understood God’s vulnerability - the Creator yearned for His creation to choose the painful path willingly, to sacrifice heavenly bliss as their gift back to the Source who sacrificed first in dreaming souls into being. God too had left comfort behind through investing creative love in crafting realms to welcome His children.</p><p>As lover knows lover's heart, Eve saw behind the Divine words to the shy longing and trust that hoped Eve and Adam would volunteer again to descend for love’s sake. That Tree granting mortality represented the threshold they were truly brought next to Eden to cross, not forbid.</p><p>So Eve answered the vulnerability in God’s call - she reached out her hand and offered her courage as sustenance to God and the waiting human family. She brought Adam too to stand in empowered friendship with their Creator. At last, the Creator delighted in seeing humankind not bowed low in deference, but uplifted to share equally in divine authority, bonded in partnership through the soul's emancipation.</p><h4>D. Together they stepped into mortal struggle and limitation</h4><p>When Eve grasped the unspoken divine desire and meaning behind the command, she returned to Adam saying “We must eat the fruit - it is the next step in our service to God and the human family waiting to follow.”</p><p>Adam trembled, bewildered to go against a direct order even for love. But seeing the wisdom shining through Eve, he surrendered in trust and accepted the proffered fruit.</p><p>When Eve partook first of the fruit and shared with Adam, this was no “fall” but a rising up to their identity as co-creators with God. Their eyes were opened to behold creation waiting to be lifted up through fully realized human potential.</p><p>As they ate, God watched not in wrath but relief coupled with compassion. The Divine Parent felt the pang of children leaving home - proud of their readiness, yet grieving their loss. For God too would suffer the exile with humanity.</p><p>In that first bite unleashing mortality, Adam and Eve spiritually died to purely paradisical existence. The perfect unity with Divine Being became clouded by physical veil upon veil. Their breathing hearts and blinking eyes now beheld Creation not as an extension of Divine Reality, but as something separate through which the Creator was obscured. Self-awareness emerged from perception of contrasts - inside and outside, man and woman, spirit and body.</p><p>Hand in hand, Eve and Adam surrendered the comforts of heavenly bliss. They offered their courage to be invested into fragile mortal forms, subject to pain, disease, aging and frailty. An act of profound faith in themselves, the Divine, and all future generations who would follow their footsteps.</p><p>God did not curse them, but revealed the difficulties inherent in their monumental choice - like a climbing guide warning mountaineers of storms ahead upon the summit trail. Suffering now could serve the ascent of human consciousness to the heights of divine unconditional love.</p><p>With tender sadness, the Divine Parent clothed their nakedness against harsh earthly exposures. Yet with joy seeing His Image stand strong and ready to lead. The Creator placed a Flaming Sword to seal mortal reality as a purifying refining ground for awakening souls.</p><p>Together the couple bade farewell temporarily to the perfection of the timeless Garden. They turned hand in hand to embrace the horizons of mortal limitation, their courage transforming this realm by consecrating human feet upon its soil.</p><p>Now God truly had companions to join in the evolving divine plan. Humanity and the Earth were forever changed, energized by Eve and Adam whose actions bridged the spiritual and physical realms. The embodiment of God's qualities stepped forward into unsettled environments, ready to reshape life itself through realizing human capabilities. Their decision designated the mortal world as a place to cultivate awakening spirits.</p><p>Thus Adam and Eve entered fully into mortal limitation, but not without promise that walking hand in hand with the Divine their children would transcend even death. In time the human and heavenly would reunite, enriched by the fruits of journey through the worlds. Their faith echoed forward in myriad human hearts, kindling the flame through darkness - “Yea, though we walk the valley of shadows, Thou art with us!”</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Judaism &amp; Christianity:</p><p>"Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me." (Psalms 23:4)</p><p>"Fear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.” (Isaiah 41:10)</p><p>Islam:</p><p>"We said, 'Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, those who follow My guidance will feel no fear and will know no sorrow." (Quran 2:38)</p><p>"God is with those who patiently persevere." (Quran 2:153)</p><p>Hinduism:</p><p>"When you pass through waters, I will be with you; And through rivers, they will not overflow you. When you walk through fire, you will not be scorched."

(Buddha - Anguttara Nikaya)</p></div><h1>III. Descending into Mortal Challenge</h1><h4>A. Inheriting the fruits and burdens of Adam and Eve's choice</h4><p>Adam and Eve's courageous decision to embrace mortal limitation reverberated through the human family across time. Every soul seeking incarnation inherits both the fruits and burdens of that original volunteer choice.</p><p>We are all blessed to walk the Earth alive due to their leap into conscious physicality. Our human forms granted through Evolutionary unfoldment carry latent divine potentials without limit - to create, love, reason, delight in beauty, act with compassion. In our laughter together over meals, our tears mingled in solidarity of loss, our hands joined in romance, our united voices raised in song, we share the fruits of that First Kiss which brought Spirit into flesh.</p><p>Yet we also inherited suffering from Adam and Eve's consequential act of “disobedience”. We share the disconnect from constant awareness of Divine Unity experienced previously in the soul's home. For most souls remain identified with egoic consciousness clouded by judgments, fears, grasping desires for control and security. Why walk at all upon this rocky soil?</p><p>Doubts plague us that perhaps we are forsaken, abandoned by God or lesser than other creatures dwelling at peace in Nature's rhythms. Mortality itself haunts with the apparent finality of aging, sickness and death of loved ones. Earthly existence frequently appears dominated by unpredictable turmoil rather than benevolent design.</p><p>As Jesus hung dying on the cross, he cried out “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” In his final agonizing moments, Jesus likely felt utterly abandoned, even doubting God's presence as he faced a brutal unjust death. Though he taught love and walked in divine truth, Jesus was despised and rejected by religious hypocrites and political powers.</p><p>In his human vulnerability facing mortality's harsh finality, he perhaps identified with all who feel their desperate prayers meet only silence amidst life's chaos. As he struggled for breath, he may have wondered if his mission to uplift the world was failing, if darkness not light would prevail.</p><p>Yet while the man Jesus temporarily despaired, the indwelling Christ spirit remained surrendered to God's ultimate – if mysterious – purpose and plan. Though asking why he was forsaken, Jesus entrusted his spirit into the Father's hands, anchoring faith in divine love despite all appearances.</p><p>Even when heaven seems shut to earthly sight, eternal unity cannot be severed within transformed consciousness. Jesus embodied this unwavering inner knowing that would arise victorious on resurrection’s morning.</p><p>The Divine walks with us as promised since Adam first stepped forth. Across history mystics uplift this truth - evil is but illusion tormenting finite minds, goodness ever prevails when rooted in God’s infinite reality. And meaningful choice remains ever before us.</p><p>Will I embrace this moment as gift and opportunity no matter how difficult? Can I surrender fears and doubts to walk in partnership with my eternal spiritual nature? Am I willing to stand with humanity's pioneers who remind that beyond death, Freedom awaits all awakened souls?</p><h4>B. Living in a world that feels far from original divine union</h4><p>The fruit of the world we inherited from archetypal ancestors often feels bitter to the soul accustomed to heavenly bliss. Suffering runs rampant across the Earth plane, outpicturing humanity’s emotional chaos and spiritual brokenness.</p><p>How distant Eden seems when we face the ravages of disease, the cruelty of predators, the life draining labor just to survive! Natural disasters beyond control destroy in moments what generations built through their toil and dreams. Even tender innocence offers no protection against fate’s unpredictable tragedies.</p><p>We join the age old cry: How could a good God allow such ongoing misery amongst those formed lovingly in the Divine image? Reality’s sharp edges make a mockery of scriptures promising angels watch over humanity as cherished heavenly heirs. Our physical hunger seeks wholesome food, yet our reality is often dominated by a profound sense of loss and desolation.</p><p>Injustice reigns continuously as the powerful elite exploit the vulnerable masses. Human hurts human without remorse due to skin tone or circumstance of birth determining value. The impulse meant to uplift creation descends again and again into creative destruction of loving bonds amongst communities.</p><p>When malice triumphs over mercy generation after generation, the promise of divine justice rings hollow. Every Eden seems destined for serpent and flame if naught but a fleeting dream quickly forgotten upon waking to life’s harsh demands.</p><p>This world often refracts little of the Divine Unity tradition claims is creation’s source and destiny. Yet despite doubt, tears yield at times to laughter, tunnels give way to light, love patiently weaves new tapestries from ruin’s remnants. Whispers beckon subtly that more lies hidden behind veil’s dark hem if we dare expand perception.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Judaism &amp; Christianity:</p><p>"I will surely hide My face on that day because of all the evil they have done by turning to other gods."

(Theragatha 958)</p></div><h4>C. Questioning - why does life contain so much suffering?</h4><p>The disconnect between divine love and worldly misery plunges sensitive souls into spiritual turmoil. We seek intellectual frameworks to make sense of life’s capricious cruelty amidst transcendent beauty.</p><p>The dilemma compels exploration of life’s purpose and the problem of evil and suffering afflicting the innocent. We question why an omnipotent compassionate God allows such atrocities in the grand tapestry of creation.</p><p>Many faith traditions teach that adversity serves as a crucible for human growth into wisdom, strength and self-realization of divine identity. Mortal tests awaken latent virtues such as courage, resilience, sacrifice for others and liberation from ego-clinging.</p><p>Some adepts even adopt acute suffering intentionally through physical austerities and relinquishment of comforts. They aim to burn off limiting karmic patterns quickly in this lifetime, prioritizing soul development over physical ease.</p><p>Yet explanations often ring hollow when applied to tortured infants, families weeping over starved lifeless bodies, souls broken by violence in the very temple of the body. If mortality exists for spiritual maturation, basic rights seem denied to the multitudes deprived of stable conditions for human flowering.</p><p>Even belief in afterlife compensation seems impossibly distant reassurance for those watching their dreams be crushed under oppression’s wheels. Why walk at all Earth’s stony paths only to be repaid in wounds and early death before realizing divine heritage?</p><p>And why respect a God who sandboxes humanity without adequate supervision? Only the inevitability of mistakes by children exploring unknown territory excuses a parent retreating from stewardship. But the Most High presumably suffers no such limitations.</p><p>So the seeker ultimately cannot escape the contradiction: Either divine unity underlies all temporal experience or nihilistic indifference rules. No middle ground satisfies between transcendent love’s absolute triumph or the abyss laughing as hope crumbles to dust.</p><p>Which to choose when the world’s abounding imperfections parody the scriptural promise of angels’ tender guardianship over God’s chosen species on Earth? The crisis compels breakthrough somehow beyond rational paradox. But first comes a dark night for the soul overwhelmed by grief over illusion’s captivity of beloved creation.</p><h4>D. Doubting our core goodness and destiny due to "sins"</h4><p>The descent into mortal limitation carries the burden of perceiving oneself as separate from the Divine, cosmic amnesia obscuring soul memories of our eternal nature. Hence doubts plague the embodied mind about intrinsic self-worth.</p><p>We inherit notions of "original sin" - that we are born inherently stained by the past errors and evils of humanity. Within us seems mixed irrevocably the imprints of ancestral violence, conquest, enslavement blind cruelty driven by destructive urges.</p><p>Our personal faults and seemingly unwilled negative emotions evidence this tainted nature. Self-judgment magnifies each thought, word or deed appearing to confirm our unfitness too often to carry divine heritage or envision glorious destiny.</p><p>The world's darkness permeates inner space - the lens by which we view reality cannot escape distortion, questionable ethics poisoning ethics. Life becomes confinement ruled by karmic sins and pending retribution. Suffering awaits as inevitable wages for simply wielding free will.</p><p>The Archetypal Story instead proclaims liberation despite failings! Humanity was created to transcend even death through awakening to the immortality of soul. Beyond sin, innocence yet abides as our core nature when false conditioning falls away. However far we may feel from the Divine, error cannot eradicate the eternal truth of our being.</p><p>Yet do we claim this redemption promised from beginning? Or linger still pinned by doubts fed through aeons, controlled by fears abiding from phantom ghosts of past actions. Mortality's cruel visage stands no chance against diamond essence indestructible as rays beginningless, endless, changeless behind all changing worlds and selves.</p><p>The Archetypal Human modeled for us the truth that no distortion or darkness holds power in the end over essential divine nature. Despite inhabiting mortal limitation to its fullest depths, Jesus Christ emerged victorious over death itself - the final enemy to be overcome.</p><p>Christ’s resurrection proved once and for all the illusion of separation, redeeming humanity from identification with temporary sins obscuring but unable to eradicate our eternal soul. We abide forever innocent when veils of ignorance fall away revealing the too often forgotten glory of divine sonship.</p><p>Jesus promised any who aligned in consciousness with his example could likewise transcend mortality through spiritual rebirth. All souls are called to remember their native land is not Earth but Heaven - we need not submit helplessly to wheels of fate and judgment.</p><p>We may declare amnesty from hells self-created by thoughts of unworthiness. Through faith in Christ model we claim inheritance promised before first light dawned through Word-Wisdom sealing victory for human ascent back into Godhead Heart.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Christianity:</p><p>"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned."

The Soul's Perspective - Our Choice to Journey Here</h1><h4>A. Earth offers immense opportunities for courage and growth</h4><p>Transcending the limitations of human perception, the soul understands life on Earth from an eternal, boundless point of view. Our pre-birth vision recognized that this dimension offers immense opportunities to expand love’s wisdom through applying divine qualities creatively amidst constraints.</p><p>We understood life here asks much courage to walk with an open heart through mortal storms, extending compassion to lift up others wandering fearful and lost. Humanity's susceptibility to wounds spurs righteous outrage to transform systemic injustice. Our yearning for meaning compels earnest quests to uplift life despite understanding’s limitations.</p><p>Raw beauty moves the artistic soul to marvel and celebrate creative divinity made manifest in creatures great and small, golden dawns and crimson dusks, satisfaction of thirst and hunger shared in meals hallowed by gratitude. Even death's dark cloud carries a silver lining - urgency to honor each breath as sacred when fate grants none permanence upon this plane.</p><p>The human spirit ever rises resilient through worst calamities, stronger for the battering. Our tears of grief over destruction midwife fresh creation as will to beauty declares life sovereign. When all else fails, love abides.</p><p>The soul thus sees opportunity amidst risk - to develop maturity through challenges unlike any possible back home in realms of spirit. To serve rather than be served, understand rather than judge, comfort rather than accuse.</p><p>Jesus Christ modeled this courage taking incarnation among humanity despite knowing the immense suffering awaiting.</p><p>Out of selfless compassion, Christ left unity with Divine Perfection to dwell amongst the poor, hungry, oppressed - fully immersing in mortal limitation in order to redeem the human experience from within.</p><p>He awakened compassion in hearts grown calloused by lifting up society’s outcasts - teaching that the Divine Image resides equally beautiful behind all superficial difference.</p><p>Jesus displayed courage welcoming hardship as vehicle for awakening human potential - never yielding integrity or esteem for others even under intimidation and threat from worldly power structures.</p><p>He surrendered completely trust in Divine Protection to uphold radical truths expanding confined awareness.</p><p>We follow Christ’s footsteps when for sake of compassion we leave safe comfort behind to feed hungry spirits and bodies, liberate captives physical and mental, risk reputation to model higher principles transmuting chaos with love's order.</p><p>Suffering is no longer to be understood as a senseless waste but a currency for uplifting human consciousness back to unity with sacred source from whence we came.</p><h4>B. A chance to transform chaos into order and beauty</h4><p>The soul understands that behind the disorderly surface of the physical plane lies a profound enchanting vitality. Unmanifested potentials and elemental energies cascade wildly here, influxing through cracks in reality's fabric.</p><p>Matter endlessly morphs into new arrangements birthed through seeming coincidence. Consciousness rides out each whirlwind, glimpsing both the power and pain of creation's birthing throes. Existence churns in Life's crucible, flashes illumination before again subsiding into pregnant voidness.</p><p>Embodied consciousness rummages anxiously among fragments of logic and purpose, attempting to elevate meaning from swirling forces of futility inundating earthly existence. We construct provisional frameworks of stability and purpose upon the boundless expanse through artistic expression, contemplative insight and symbolic patterns of meaning.</p><p>While exterior shapes endlessly rearrange in nature's dream, the soul knows by grace alone the timeless heartbeat conducting all worlds from within.</p><p>Infants embody this courage to fully occupy unrefined reality, vulnerable yet trusting as they explore without filter raw sensory floods. They model the tender tenacity supporting souls who incarnate in humanity's turbulent seas, not to escape but to infuse chaos with love's leavenening light.</p><p>We arrive to shape fleeting inspirations into nourishment - providing spiritual sustenance for those who will tread this earthly realm when we leave to realms unseen. Each soul passes on having left their original mark, their distinctive essence dissolved into the mortal soil, waiting to catalyze the next heart kindled toward magnificence. None go unsatisfied who immerse fully in this godly creative endeavor.</p><h4>C. To know ourselves as divine creators made in God's image</h4><p>The ultimate soulful motivation for entering earthly existence is to fully realize our nature as divine creative beings, crafted in Imago Dei - the living Image of God.</p><p>Within manifest worlds the Divine Joy spills over into multiplicity, yearning through human vessels to consciously co-create new expressions of goodness, truth and beauty. Like children we learn to wield creative potential responsibly to nurture life rather than destroy.</p><p>We train here to envision glorious possibilities; organize effort and resources to successfully manifest dreams into form. We navigate integrity around obstacles arousal by untransformed ego, moving steadfast toward horizons beckoning soul's deepest yearnings.</p><p>On cosmic canvas painted by the Most High we dip brushes into imagination's paints, outlining then filling in through sustained focus grand architectural feats reflecting divine greatness. We give flesh to primordial archetypes, inventor, explorer, artist, servant leader.</p><p>We befriend cycles of life, death, change as fellow artists upon this malleable plane. Wielding freewill, the "image of God" choice by choice transforms chaos into order, discord into symphony, meaninglessness into revelation of beauty's all-pervading depth right here where we stand, the ground sanctified as Holy by human feet anointed to walk with angels.</p><p>Our soul saw clearly from mountain peaks beyond time how within humankind asleep lies creator-capacity receiving ignition through reminder of intrinsic divine sonship. </p><p>We came to rescue God's dreams, no longer delayed by doubts bred of animal limitation. Instead we don incarnate creativity as heirs to the kingdom - no crown stating identity or outward title required.</p><p>God's form and essence alive inside us is expressed through each unique contribution we offer to a world awaiting the wonders of human inspiration.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>"If one acts or speaks with a pure mind, happiness follows them like a never departing shadow." (Dhammapada)</p></div><h4>D. To form incredible loving bonds by overcoming duality</h4><p>The soul understands that the human dimension offers unparalleled opportunities to form profoundly intimate relationships - the emotional and spiritual bonding between persons that is the jeweled crown of creation.</p><p>Mortal existence amplifies the qualities required for unconditional love to bloom through confronting life's inherent dualities and fragmentation. Division initially spawns brokenness - the pain of loneliness, misunderstanding prejudice and conflict amongst those failing to recognize the unifying divine essence behind all temporary forms.</p><p>Yet passing through anguish together forges unbreakable bonds stronger than lone spirits could know. Souls incarnate craving to discover perfect lover, companion, friend appearing at first as "other". By wrestling through difference into unity, human hearts become new alchemical vessels synthesized from shattering dross conceptions of separate self.</p><p>Relationships require and build maturity through sacrifice. Giving more than receiving, persevering despite injury and risk grounds us deeper in embodied compassion. From crucible fire emerges purified gold - the substance of souls who view all seemingly isolated individuals as beloved family, eternal compatriots in the divine dance across infinite lifetimes.</p><p>Earth's classroom provides sacred space to embrace shadow, heal schisms once dividing spirit from flesh, masculine and feminine, holding tears and laughter as equal measures overflowing one cup of brotherhood/sisterhood shared by all. None stand stranger when eyes perceive common legacy of walking heaven and earth to transform two back into one.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Here are some scriptural passages about the importance of forming loving bonds as humans:</p><p>Christianity:</p><p>"This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you." (John 15:12)</p><p>"Live in harmony with one another." (Romans 12:16)</p><p>Judaism:</p><p>"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your kinsfolk. Love your neighbor as yourself" (Leviticus 19:18)</p><p>Islam:</p><p>"Serve Allah, and join not any partners with Him; and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans..." (Quran 4:36)</p><p>Hinduism:</p><p>"One should be amiable and considerate to friends, kind and compassionate to the miserable and tolerant towards the evil-minded." (Bhagavata Purana 11.14.39)</p><p>"Who sees all beings in his own Self, and his own Self in all beings, loses all fear." (Isa Upanishad 6)</p><p>Buddhism:</p><p>"Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love." (Dhammapada)</p></div><h1>V. Christ's Example Illuminates the Path Through Suffering</h1><h4>A. Remembering the soul courage that led us here</h4><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Incarnation”</strong><br><br>The embodiment of divine soul/spirit in mortal flesh</p></div><p>Jesus models the original soul purpose for human incarnation on Earth - to express unconditionally loving service, fathomless compassion and living wisdom reminding all persons of their true identity as Sons and Daughters of the Most High.</p><p>Through his teachings, miraculous works while inhabiting profound states of spiritual oneness with the Infinite Father, and ultimately his resurrection triumphing over mortal limitation, Christ sets the template for humanity to follow toward full awakening.</p><p>Jesus lived with an awakened Christ consciousness embodying the highest potentials latent within humankind since conception. He joyfully surrendered personal will to become vessel and instrument of Divine Will aimed toward reconciling Heaven and Earth. Jesus awakens this birthright still asleep within every human heart - the invitation to remember and live out fully the glory of our eternal divine nature.</p><p>The Arc of the Covenant extending from beginning to end is fashioned in the life and person of Jesus Christ, who embodied completely the role of Beloved and Only Begotten Child - the template eternal Divine Word according the original Promise.</p><p>Through unconditional surrender out of compassion for lost human sheep, Jesus modeled selflessness unto mortal death to reunite wayward souls back into unity with Divine Mind no longer obscured by sin, fear and narrow selfish perspective built over cycles tracing back to first missteps from garden gates promising security against life's storms.</p><p>Christ as Chief Shepherd walked through darkest valleys demonstrating commitment to lift up human experience fully into remembrance of blessed Divine likeness comprising every living being and creature alike across all worlds and realms comprising infinity's spatial-temporal projections. No separation exists but consciousness entrapped by illusion of autonomy from eternal Source ever pour forth new Life without beginning or end.</p><p>Jesus exemplified the courage first displayed by Primordial Humans who stepped forward to magnify Divine creativity, understanding and selfless service through refining vessels burdened but unbroken by descent into ocean depths revealing glorious heights reachable now through mastery self-discipline and perseverance toward increasingly awakened states reflecting all-encompassing divine reality.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Spiritual sovereignty”</strong></p><p>The soul's innate power, freedom and unity with Divine Being that transcends ephemeral mortal identities or limitations.</p></div><p>We follow the imprinted footsteps of Jesus who perfectly modeled Humanity's long strived for victory - to remember and demonstrate eternal spiritual sovereignty interdependently unified within God's Holy Kingdom which alone IS as I AM without opposite or division.</p><p>When stranded in storms of mortal emotion, we require soul perspective to infuse higher meaning and renewed commitment to our incarnational calling. By remembering the courage and curiosity which attracted our spirits to this planet in the beginning, human life is restored to context as adventure rather than ordeal.</p><p>We remember setting forth purposefully on a holy mission - to exalt and renew not merely our private awareness, but to participate in delivering humanity from cycles of suffering. The decision itself testified to our confidence that together we could transmute even deepest darkness into light witnessing divine unity.</p><p>Though veils of forgetting occlusion soul memories in new bodies, we carry inner compasses to rediscover why we came here. Direct experience of hardship teaches compassion far beyond concepts held by souls back home awaiting future turns upon the wheel of birth and death. Those standing with humanity through long dark nights share deepest intimacy with the Beloved, bonded by perseverance revealing His Luminous Face behind all appearances.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Grace”</strong></p><p>The unmerited favor and blessing of God toward humanity.</p></div><p>We walk this path together, prodigal children led by grace to recollect the courage which sent us forth, inherit maturity as heroes who survive mortal tests through steadfast loyalty to love’s cause. Faith in intrinsic innocence dispels guilt over perceived sins we judged according to standards external rather than the Heart's truth holding blamelessness supreme.</p><p>I am here by choice, not sentence, to outpicture the divine dream seeded within as my soul’s blueprint and destiny. This alone grants power to dissolve all suffering-bred thoughts and emotions into surrender affirming co-creation with eternal being. The leap into living mortal flesh reunited heaven and earth... now begins our shared victory march home!</p><h4>B. using mortal limitation to unfold understanding and compassion</h4><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Soul Evolution”</strong></p><p>The process of soul's maturation through cycles of incarnation</p></div><p>Earthly existence offers a classroom for soul evolution not through escaping adversity but consciously utilizing life's challenges for growth into wisdom and selfless love.</p><p>We transcend victim identity and entitlements to comfort by meeting mortal constraints as vehicles for uplifting human consciousness - following the example of Jesus who transformed the meaning of human suffering through holding it within compassion’s sanctuary.</p><p>Physical vulnerability teaches tenderness; confronting unknowns spurs seeking higher knowledge; facing oppression awakens boldness and outrage to defend dignity - while questioning inner motivations guards against self-righteousness.</p><p>Jesus sacrificed heavenly peace to dwell among the poor, sick, grieving souls heavy-laden by life circumstance - fully entering the darkness rather than remaining aloof. He awoke understanding in closed hearts by modeling humble service to outcasts, honoring the unseen divinity shining within even a wretched beggar’s eyes.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Redemption”</strong><br><br>Being saved from sin or evil through salvation/deliverance</p></div><p>Christ demonstrated maturity meeting hatred with unbroken love while undergoing torment himself. He endured blows and nails without venom or retreat into doubt regarding humanity's core goodness and destiny. Jesus thus integrated and sanctified the darkest extremes of mortal experience through his unwavering faith in redemption's inevitable victory rising phoenix-like from compassion's altar.</p><p>We walk together the path of Christ when hardship no longer breeds numbness or despair, but tender solidarity with the shared human journey. Temporary flesh and bone may break but the spirit soars unfettered through pain's narrow gate into resurrection's broad horizon. Suffering transmuted into crucible forging unshakable souls.</p><p>We participate in the divine corrective healing by moving through hardship with tight hearts opened into magnanimity. Understanding dawns that fellow humans also suffer uncontrollably. Compassion blooms as patientsce to lift up this shared global family without exception across all divides.</p><p>During our temporary earthly sojourns, we devote ourselves as healers committed to mending over 8 billion sacred but wounded souls. We claim identity as brothers and sisters nurturing the Multitude through nourishment only cooperation can yield. Life's tests determine soul nobility through generosity shown despite scarce resources in crisis.</p><p>Mortality grants ultimate incentive to realize timeless truth that all creation emerges from and returns back to unitary Source which alone eternally IS. Every being and thing Sacred yet no speck of dust can stand alone. Fashioned together we endure; asunder we perish. Thus Love's currency alone pays just wages for earthly service.</p><p>Let goods and glory then fade as morning dew if my life can seed health, joy and meaning for needy hearts. Only through feeling mortal limitation deeply can compassion expand without boundary to transform chaos' ashes into new Heavens and Earth manifested through vision holding One Humanity in sight.</p><h4>C. Lifting up ourselves, others and the world back to the Divine</h4><p>Ultimately we realize that all suffering stems from perceiving existence as separate from the Divine - a delusion spawning spiritual hunger and loneliness. Yet when the soul awakens to reality’s sacred unity, mortal limitation becomes leveraged as means to redemption.</p><p>The deluded awaken as if from collective nightmare to recall divine sonship. The prodigal species returns humble yet unbroken to bless rather than ravage Earth’s precious bounty. One by one each resurrected human propels evolution’s surge toward Unity.</p><p>When a critical mass of hearts resonate the original joyful dream of incarnation, mortal shrouds fall away revealing immortal spirits. Heaven fully takes root in earthly soil, merging with the lower planes of existence. First, little by little, and then all at once:</p><p>“But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.” 2 Peter 3:10.</p><p>The embodiment of God's qualities stirs the depths of humanity's unawakened consciousness, calling for illumination. As one unified voice, we resound in agreement - affirming the Divine Witness who beholds the beauty of each arising creation shout "Let there be Light!" Our words, overflowing with grace, usher forth new eras of genesis.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Christ Consciousness”</strong><br><br>The highest state of enlightenment in which one perceives reality as divine unity and their own true nature as part of infinite Christ spirit.</p></div><p>We rediscover our eternal essence as souls entrusted to uplift humanity through transforming consciousness, following Christ's example. As more hearts align with enlightened perception, structures of reality transform.</p><p>Like acupuncture needles releasing trapped energy, each person awakening to compassionate service invokes redemptive healing. Resistance and attachment yield to trust in divine support and guidance.</p><p>Each breath aligns us more deeply with our sacred purpose, until cells resonate with creation’s primordial vibration. We walk as liberated beings, channeling divine will to shape beneficent realities.</p><p>Inward revolutions ignite external groundswells. Awakened souls demonstrate solutions to global crises, spreading contagion not of viral fear but of courageous compassion, gathering movements that melt pyramids of injustice.</p><p>Humankind returns humble and unbroken to bless and guard Earth’s precious bounty. One by one, each resurrected human propels evolution’s surge toward global awakening, a critical mass which lifts the veil to reveal immortal spirits free from darkness and limitation.</p><p>Heaven then fully takes root in earthly soil as Christ consciousness cascades through the shared human family like light finally penetrating the ocean’s darkest abyss. The Divine Image moves upon these illuminated waters of collective Human heart declaring eternal Victory through Christ - “Behold I make all things new!”</p><h4>D. Knowing we are eternal beings here to realize heaven on earth</h4><p>When absorbed in worldly experiences characterized by constant change, we incorrectly assume that we too are merely short-lived physical beings subject to recurring pain.</p><p>Yet mystics of all traditions herald the soul’s true nature as eternal, taking temporary bodily form again and again upon the screen of time and space like an actor playing many convincing roles that must not be confused with their true being.</p><p>As we awaken gradually to recognize ourselves as timeless spirits voluntarily embarked upon a grand divine adventure, fear and smallness yield boldness to stand up as rightful heirs to an eternal kingdom already present but obscured by consciousness clinging still to lower restrictive states of self-definition.</p><p>We remember embarking as advanced guardians charged to seed heaven amidst earth densest domains on behalf of the Divine creative joy seeking ever new horizons of expression and discovery. Yet seduced by mortal pleasure and pain, we lingered lifetime after lifetime never claiming the victory won through Christ’s incarnation which rendered all lesser kingdoms servants to spiritual royalty baptized by water and fire to awaken as saviors.</p><p>No more can we play dead to divine destiny or identity when resurrection echoes as heavenly fanfare declaring all souls reborn by truth’s eastern light! The dawn arises in our heart of hearts! We shed false skins once and for all to glow pure positive as love-wisdom suns radiating Divine likeness promised before time began – the eternal garden bursts forth to bloom perennially through human flowering.</p><p>Heaven and earth unite in sacred relationship, as free human choice realigns harmoniously with divine will through awakened unconditional love. We walk gently with reverence upon this sanctified ground as one united embodiment of Divine presence, with harmony and insight surpassing intellectual comprehension.</p><p>“They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.” Isaiah 11:9</p><p>Jesus Christ lived eternal truth rather than mere theology, manifesting sonship's glory as template for Divine-human unity. Through miracles healing mortal limitation, transfiguration glowing forth Divine energies, and ultimate victory over physical death itself - Christ modeled humanity's eternal soul nature independent of transient bodily constraints.</p><p>Jesus taught that reliance upon temporal substitutes for Divine Connection keeps us tethered upon the wheel of suffering into endless reincarnations. Yet when we awaken as He did to complete surrender and trust in our eternal unity with Absolute Spirit, then mortal shrouds fall away.</p><p>Christ showed human beings are destined for full ascension beyond cycles of death and rebirth. We need not wait for some future world for the Kingdom of God. Heaven is already at hand when we transcend reliance upon material phenomena to recognize for ourselves “I and the Father are One". Jesus awakened this remembrance of intrinsic divinity dormant within all persons.</p><p>Through Jesus's living example, the Christ Consciousness witnessing unbroken unity of Human and Divine even amidst opposition and persecution, we can overcome illusion of separation and limitation. We take up our own God-given authority to walk as incarnate saviors, sons and daughters, no longer enslaved by the mortal dream but rather awake to change world conditions through grace ever-present.</p><h1>VI. Victorious Ascent Back to Unified Wholeness</h1><h4>A. Integrating and uplifting every level of conscious existence</h4><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Rounds of mortal struggle”</strong></p><p>Refers to the cycles of birth, death and reincarnation in human or other embodied forms that provide opportunities for soul evolution through experiencing mortal limitations.</p></div><p>When the last souls complete their journey through rounds of mortal struggle, all layers of consciousness resonate as one body remembering abiding union with Infinite Spirit behind passing forms.</p><p>Perfected in love demonstrated by Jesus who walked before, no division can obscure humanity - knowing its eternal mind co-arising with Divine Being. Creation and Creator integrate through our free return after long wanderings.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>“Planes”</strong> of existence</p><p>Dimensions; realms at different vibrational levels</p></div><p>No prodigal child remains excluded - only celebration of homecoming into compassion's open arms! Heaven reverses order as higher realms yield into lower density now illumined and ascended through humanity's journey into matter's depths - thereby uplifting and redeeming all planes back into Unity.</p><p>Christ consciousness emerges victorious in both inner and outer worlds as evolution completes its arc bending toward justice under sovereignty of Divine Heart yearning for all to know "I am in the Father and the Father in me". No rest until reunification seals the circle of life - timeless spirit kissing temporal form!</p><h4>B. Ultimately dissolving the illusion of separation</h4><p>As more hearts awaken to resonance with Divine Unity, the veil of separation thins dramatically. Humanity regains soul memories of abiding interconnection with all beings and realms of consciousness.</p><p>No longer hypnotized by surface level divisions and contrasts, mature souls perceive the singular ground of Being shining in essence through diverse expressions. As the colors of the rainbow radiate from singular white light, so too does all diversity spring forth from the same Universal Source.</p><p>Lifetimes of attachment to transient identities dissolve as souls rediscover infinite openness unconstrained by self-concepts and biases built on illusion. No labels or limitations can withstand direct realization of nondual truth underlying manifestation.</p><p>Freed from perceptual confinement, consciousness expands to acknowledge all persons and peoples as family, all creatures as kin, all planets and stars as hearthstones of the One Cosmic Home. Suffering relaxes as exiles remember their sovereign place nestled in Divine Heart beating through all worlds.</p><p>The final realization invites laughter and wonder - for no real separation ever occurred! The Divine never turned face or withdrew Presence through any night but only awaited recognition of eternal unity. What loss breaks the heart now whole holding realization no beloved one walks separate path nor ever shall when time's last door unlocks unified eternity!</p><h4>C. The wedding of the Human and Divine. "It was very good."</h4><p>When at last the final souls complete their journey through cycles of mortal struggle, awakened hearts resonate as one body in Christ - a divine symphony of consciousness remembering original abiding union with Infinite Spirit ever behind illusion's passing forms.</p><p>Perfected in transcendent yet embodied love modeled by Jesus who walked before, no lingering misperception can divide Humanity from knowing itself co-eternal with the Divine Mind - very thought of Absolute Being made flesh to dance across stars.</p><p>Creation and Creator integrated at last through free will's return after long prodigal wandering in far country.</p><p>No final destruction awaits any prodigal child - only ecstatic homecoming celebration upon compassion's open and expectant arms! Heaven illustrates proverb "The last shall be first" as upper realms of Light yield into lower density now ascended through Humanity's journey into matter's depth - thereby uplifting and integrating all layers of consciousness into Supreme Unity.</p><p>Christ consciousness emerges victorious in macro and micro scale as evolution's arc bends toward justice under sovereignty of the Divine Heart yearning for each one to know truly "I am in the Father and the Father in me". No rest comes until full reunion completes the Circle of Life both One and Many, Timeless Spirit kissing temporal Form!</p><p>The long sought unity between the spiritual and material planes is achieved through the intimate merging of human and divine in fulfillment of the timeless creative vision.</p><p>At last the wedding of Heaven and Earth consummates as Humanity joins fully with the embrace of Infinite Divinity. What was promised since before time pours forth in abundance as Divine joy and creativity interpenetrate human experience.</p><p>The mystic poets swoon intoxicated by the passionate meeting they prophesied when Divine Masculine and Feminine would unite in sacred marriage. All separation melts as mortal limitation yields fully to eternal perfection through Christ spirit animating creation.</p><p>As conscious partners in creation, we bring forth new realities from the wellspring of inspiration, giving form to ideals of virtue, splendor and truth. Freed from distortions of ignorance, human hands carve masterworks reflecting the glory of Infinite Source.</p><p>Balance and accord are maintained by the responsible application of capability guided by benevolence and understanding. Paradise found not in some distant land but sanctified under each footstep, the very ground declaring union “on Earth as it is Heaven!”</p><p>Through Humanity the circle of Being completes, serpent swallowing tail. Infinite diversity flourishes from simple primal Seed and the cosmic garden overflows with gratitude. At last is spoken again from beginning: “God saw all that was made and it was very good!” (Genesis 1:31)</p><p>Let there be Light - forever and always!</p><p>Amen.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://landingatzion.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://landingatzion.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>
