Authority figures like bosses help ensure we are using our skills productively. Police officers protect us from harm, and government officials ensure the wise stewardship of resources. And yet - all power structures have limitations. We can clearly see that our world is still in a state of disorder, without a clear path forward to the world of abundance. Many people are still without basic necessities, such as food, clothing, and shelter, as one example.</p><p>While we wait for God’s final redemption, all have the opportunity to work to influence higher-grade power towards greater alignment with Landing at Zion, while also recognizing the current reality of power dynamics. We should neither submit unquestioningly to misaligned power, nor should we engage in unproductive conflict. Instead, we must skillfully navigate the space between, always working towards greater harmony and alignment.</p><p>This approach requires discernment, courage, and a long-term perspective. It recognizes that the journey to Landing at Zion is a gradual process of transformation, not an overnight revolution. By consistently acting from a place of wisdom and compassion, even those with lesser power can play a significant role in this shift.</p><p>Here’s 6 methods for interacting positively with existing power structures. We’ll evaluate each for accuracy and utility, and provide an example.</p><h1>1. Respectful Engagement with Awareness</h1><p>This approach recognizes the interconnected nature of organizational structures while seeking to positively influence the system. It contributes to Landing at Zion by attempting to align higher powers with more harmonious practices.</p><p>Accuracy: Aligns with the interconnected nature of reality and the principle that all parts of a system influence each other.</p><p>Utility: Can create opportunities for positive influence and change.</p><p>Example: The middle manager respectfully engages with C-level executives, maintaining awareness of the power dynamics at play. They look for opportunities to subtly influence decisions towards more ethical and sustainable practices, using their position as a bridge between upper management and ground-level realities.</p><h1>2. Amplification of Positive Aspects</h1><p>This approach works with existing energy in the system, aligning with physics principles of energy transformation. It contributes to Landing at Zion by nurturing and expanding positive elements within existing power structures.</p><p>Accuracy: Reflects the principle that energy can be redirected and amplified within a system.</p><p>Utility: Encourages shift towards more constructive use of power.</p><p>Example: The community organizer identifies any positive initiatives or tendencies within the higher power structures (e.g., a corporation's CSR program) and works to amplify and expand these, demonstrating their value and encouraging their growth.</p><h1>3. Creation of Alternative Power Structures</h1><p>This approach acknowledges the potential for new, more aligned structures to emerge within a system. It contributes to Landing at Zion by creating models of power use that are more in harmony with the desired end state.</p><p>Accuracy: Aligns with the emergence of new patterns and structures in complex systems.</p><p>Utility: Provides alternatives to misaligned power structures, contributing to overall harmony.</p><p>Example: The teacher, recognizing systemic issues in the educational hierarchy, works with colleagues to create alternative structures like teacher-led professional development or collaborative curriculum design. These structures demonstrate more harmonious ways of using power.</p><h1>4. Ethical Resistance and Truth-Telling</h1><p>This approach recognizes the potential for seemingly small actions to have significant impacts in an interconnected system. It contributes to Landing at Zion by upholding ethical standards and challenging misaligned uses of power.</p><p>Accuracy: Reflects the principle that all parts of a system have influence, even if not immediately apparent.</p><p>Utility: Challenges misaligned uses of power, potentially catalyzing change.</p><p>Example: The small business owner, when encountering unethical practices from larger corporations or governmental bodies, engages in ethical resistance. This might involve whistleblowing, participating in boycotts, or simply standing firm in their own ethical practices despite pressure.</p><h1>5. Inner Cultivation and Vibrational Influence</h1><p>This approach acknowledges the potential for inner states to influence broader reality, aligning with quantum principles. It contributes to Landing at Zion by maintaining and propagating harmonious states even in challenging circumstances.</p><p>Accuracy: Aligns with quantum principles of non-local influence and the power of coherent states.</p><p>Utility: Contributes to overall harmony through personal alignment and potential non-local effects.</p><p>Example: The social worker, when faced with rigid and unhelpful bureaucratic power, focuses on cultivating their own inner state of peace, compassion, and alignment with higher principles. They maintain this state even in challenging interactions, with the understanding that this inner coherence can have subtle but powerful effects on their environment.</p><h1>6. Strategic Collaboration and Network Building</h1><p>This approach recognizes the power of networks and collective action in complex systems. It contributes to Landing at Zion by creating more robust, distributed power structures aligned with harmonious principles.</p><p>Accuracy: Reflects the power of interconnected networks in complex systems.</p><p>Utility: Builds collective power that can more effectively influence higher-grade power structures.</p><p>Example: The middle manager builds networks with like-minded individuals across different organizations and sectors. These networks share information, resources, and strategies for promoting more ethical and sustainable practices, creating a collective influence greater than any individual could exert.</p>
