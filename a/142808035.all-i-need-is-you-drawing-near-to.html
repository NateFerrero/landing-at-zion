He repeats: “All I need is you”, referring to God. While salvation is the critical center of the Gospel, the good news extends far beyond salvation into every aspect of our lives.</p><p>The ultimate message of the gospel is that God desires to give good gifts to his children. If we separate truth from lies, discerning what is of God and what is not of God, and don’t let go of God through “thick and thin”, he will richly bless us. Jesus came not only to save us, but also that we might have “life… more abundantly” as written in John 10:10.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>Matthew 7:7-11</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?<br>11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!</p><p><strong>James 1:17</strong> (NKJV)<br><br>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.</p><p><strong>John 10:10</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.</p></div><p>Could it be that God is simply waiting for us to show up and ask in faith? Could the whole world be in a state of turmoil, simply because we haven’t firmly believed in God’s promises, to receive them?</p><h3>Ask in faith</h3><p>But what does it mean to “ask”? Surely it’s a bit more involved than making arbitrary demands of the Father. How then are we to obtain the promises of God? The Bible tells us that in order to receive God’s promises, we need to draw near unto him with our whole heart. Now that’s true asking!</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>Matthew 21:21-22 </strong>(NKJV)</p><p>So Jesus answered and said to them, “Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ it will be done. 22 And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”</p><p><strong>James 4:7-8</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. 8 Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</p><p><strong>Jeremiah 29:11-13</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. 12 Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. 13 And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart.</p></div><p>If God wants the best for us, and we believe his word is true, what is the missing component in our lives, and in our fallen world? We need to do as James 4:8 instructs: Draw near to God.</p><h3>Draw near to God</h3><p>How do we draw near to God? By practicing the Biblical concept of spiritual discernment in our lives by filling our hearts with His word. We need to breathe the living word of God until Spirit and flesh are united in one being, this is the art and science of “drawing near to God”.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>Hebrews 4:12</strong> (NKJV)<br><br>12 For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p><p><strong>Song of Solomon 8:6</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>Set me as a seal upon your heart, As a seal upon your arm; For love is as strong as death, Jealousy as cruel as the grave; Its flames are flames of fire, A most vehement flame.</p><p><strong>1 Corinthians 2:12-15 </strong> (NKJV)</p><p>12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. 13 These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. 15 But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one.</p></div><p>What does it mean to be spiritually discerning? How do we know what is of God and what is not? The answer to this question is critical to unleashing the blessings of God upon our world.</p><h3>Unleashing the blessing</h3><p>We know we need faith - but what if we are only “mostly sure” about God’s promises? How do we obtain faith in the blessing to come? What is the absolute assuredness that these promises will indeed come to pass? Let’s consider the following scriptures:</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>1 John 5:6-7</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>This is He who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth. For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.</p><p><strong>Numbers 23:19</strong> (NKJV)</p><p> “God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent.<br>Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?</p><p><strong>Hebrews 6:18-20</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>18 that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us. 19 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil, 20 where the forerunner has entered for us, even Jesus, having become High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</p></div><p>Did you catch that? The Spirit <strong>is</strong> literally truth! Because we know that the Spirit is truth, and that it is impossible for God to lie, we have hope as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast. This is a solid foundation upon which we can cast all doubts. God is faithful and true to lead us. If we seek the truth, he will, without exception, reveal it to us. The Spirit, nurtured by living daily in the word, quickens us to activate spiritual discernment within our body, heart, mind, and soul. This allows us to walk the narrow path that leads to life more effectively. When the truth is deeply embedded in your being, the Spirit will instruct you with clarity. We must eradicate sin from our lives, and turn to God. Only then will the fount of God’s blessing flow freely upon our world.</p><h3>Our God is merciful</h3><p>What blessed day awaits us, the moment we turn to him with our whole heart! And if we are temporarily lost, or entangled in sin, never fear. The God that leaves the 99 sheep to search for the one that is lost is just glad to have you back in the fold. He is faithful and just to forgive those who confess their sins. Let us remember that we were created to experience the goodness of God.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>Psalm 86:5</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>5 For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive,<br>And abundant in mercy to all those who call upon You.</p><p><strong>Psalm 107:8-9</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,<br>And for His wonderful works to the children of men!<br>9 For He satisfies the longing soul,<br>And fills the hungry soul with goodness.</p><p><strong>Joel 3:18</strong> (NKJV)</p><p>And it will come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drip with new wine, the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall be flooded with water; A fountain shall flow from the house of the Lord and water the Valley of Acacias.</p></div><p>We should not get distracted on this journey: there is one destination for those who love God. The blessings are fixed with the design of the universe, and God will not take them away from those who earnestly seek Him. May we all exhort one another continually to provoke each other to a true examination of our hearts daily. The only question that remains is, are we ready to have it all?</p>
