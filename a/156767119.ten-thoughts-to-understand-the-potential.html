in all the ways humans have "leaned on" or benefited from the natural operation of a wild species, or bred some initially wild species into a captive or farmed species.</p><h3>5</h3><p>The light of animals is good and exceptional in its existence, and yet it must be traded for human light when there is just moral reason to "Lean on the Biosphere's Battery of Divine Revelation", such as potential starvation, living in extreme climates like the Inuit, or an obscure lifestyle like nomadic bloodletting tribes of Namibia. These animals are more than happy to die (or bleed) in service of a just and valid cause. The issue with eating meat becomes when our individual lives are not significantly improved such that we can increase our service to God if we had the boost of animal protien.</p><h3>6</h3><p>God has appointed us all as stewards of the Vision of the Return of the Entire Biosphere of Earth to implement the Sacred Vision of Mount Zion. God's infinite law is attuned in perfect harmony, and all who visit stream out with a perfected consciousness, suddenly transformed by it's Contact. This revelation of Zion leads to the Implementation of Eden, as Eden's substance and qualities become revealed, first by the saints, and now by all who participate in Kingdom Consciousness.</p><h3>7</h3><p>A necessity of a "closing of the books" to account and to answer with finality the question, "What GOOD, POSITIVE, UPLIFTING, QUALITY forms of existence were derived from the exploitation of animals?" The humans will be automatically judged by the balance of the forces of nature based on their derivation of kingdom-qualified reformation of the biosphere, since that is the only ultimate Move of Humanity + God in Unison that leads to the eternal state of communion with God. As of Now, God has "looked away" for a moment, by looking at his Son instead of our failures. So, judgement for each act will be required, and in Christ is mercy for all paths and choices.</p><h3>8</h3><p>In Conclusion, it is a Sacred Right of the Individual to choose whether or not to consume animal products. Parents must never interfere with their children's choice to eat or not to eat. I have seen parents that respect their child's choice (whether yes or no) and I have seen parents that impose both veganism on a child that would eat meat (and probably Requires meat for their soul journey) and those on an angelic-level 9.9/10 baby child that is pure innocence and has very little to no karmic damage accumulated and asks at every meal not to eat meat at 2 years old. So, God through the child's soul is fully capable of revealing what is necessary. If the child chooses to eat meat, meat should be provided and no judgement should be passed, since certain genetic codes evolved in conjunction with eating meat, and the body could fail without it, depending on final genome combination. No one should ever force a child to eat meat, as the child is the best judge of the energetic content needed for vitality and sustenance.</p><h3>9</h3><p>Moderation - even if the child eats meat, a "frail" type person in life will find eating meat very heavy on the spirit over time, and generally eat little to no meat - but this is a sacred right of an individual to discover - not decide - about themselves and where they are on the moral arc of ascenscion into Zion. We're coming from the extreme darkness into the light. Think about how much light is here right now - and a massive amount of it because of the "dent" in the visage of God's beauty that the animals killed for it's creation required. Immense amounts of animals are still killed daily to provide the electricity and oil needed to power our civilization, and it is currently not possible to instantly transition. The trick will be to use what the sacrifice of the animals caused us to be able to do in order to discover and implement an animal-exploitation free future. We can do it, with the help of the animals currently sacrificed to boost our collective abilities as a race. This is not to say that is the "right" choice - but it is the "real" truth. So, we cannot deny or enforce meat on our children.</p><h3>10</h3><p>Finally, Kosher or Halal is a religious choice</p><p>For me: I prefer Kosher AND Halal as valid in my world, because:</p><p>- both require thanking God for the sacrifice</p><p>- both require religious inspection of the process and environment</p><p>So, this is a good ethical minimum requirement that ensures we avoid the most unethical practices and places, while making reasonable progress to reduce the amount of meat consumed as a whole species, and respecting the absolute unvioable spiritually demanded right of freedom of choice of the individual to consume what they want to, as long as they know what they are choosing. If they are too young to verbally communicate, offer a small amount of meat and the child will decide. It might feel bad to us, but it could be the correct morality for that child to be eating meat, depending on the genetic lineage.</p><p>All will be eventually corrected and judged, but we need everyone's adjustment to make a difference - not just our personal veganism. Doing our part is good, but this is a long term transformation of humanity at work, and we cannot judge the bits of human flesh that are still animal-dependent. And, we must acknowledge that even if we are vegan ourselves, we still benefit from animal-powered people working manufacturing, transportation, and all other forms of labor without which we could scarecely survive. So, we cannot be free of the fact that we are a karmic burden on animals. There is zero escaping that fact, even if we choose to show that we don't eat meat, 99.8% of our total life capacity is still derived from animal sources, because we wouldn't have roads, jobs, etc. For this reason, I think we can never judge the child that wants to eat meat, and it would be wrong to deny him/her that.</p>
