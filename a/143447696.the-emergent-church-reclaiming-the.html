As the old certainties crumble and new challenges emerge, the call to live as <a href="https://landingatzion.substack.com/p/jeshurun">Jeshurun</a> - the upright remnant wholly devoted to God - takes on a new urgency. This is a call to reclaim the divine spark within, to shed the accretions of tradition and culture, and to embrace a more authentic and transformative faith. As Phyllis Tickle argues in "The Great Emergence," the Church is undergoing a seismic shift, a once-in-500-years transformation that is reshaping the very contours of Christianity. The question is, how will we respond?</p><p>In this article, we will embark on a journey of rediscovery, unearthing the ancient wisdom of Jeshurun and its profound implications for the Church today. We will explore what it means to live as the upright remnant in an age of compromise, drawing from the deep wells of biblical truth and the insights of Christian luminaries throughout the ages.</p><p>May we emerge from these pages with a renewed sense of our true identity, a deeper commitment to the way of Jeshurun, and a burning passion to be the upright remnant that God has called us to be.</p><h3>The Biblical Vision</h3><p>At the heart of this emergent movement is a return to the biblical vision of Jeshurun - a people set apart for God, a holy nation called to embody His character and purposes in the world. As we see in Deuteronomy 32 and 33, Jeshurun is a community defined by its devotion to God, its commitment to righteousness, and its willingness to stand apart from the surrounding culture. In a world that often celebrates conformity and compromise, the way of Jeshurun is a radical call to countercultural living, a summons to be a transformative presence in the midst of a broken and hurting world.</p><p>This call to live as Jeshurun is not a call to retreat from the world but to <strong>engage it more deeply</strong>, to be a transformative presence in the midst of the brokenness and beauty of human life. It is a call to strip away the nonessential and the superficial, to rise above the din of a culture that beckons us to conform, and to embrace a more authentic and radical faith.</p><h3>Phyllis Tickle's "The Great Emergence"</h3><p>In her seminal work, "The Great Emergence," Phyllis Tickle argues that the Church is undergoing a profound transformation, a once-in-500-years shift that is reshaping the very nature of Christianity. She suggests that this "emergent" movement is characterized by a breaking down of old structures and a re-forming of the Church in response to the cultural, intellectual, and technological changes of our time. As Tickle writes, "Emergence is, in fact, a rich and fascinating time of experimentation and spiritual entrepreneurship, even as it is a time of immense upheaval and confusion."</p><p>The emergent Church is a community of inquiry, imagination, and integration, where faith and life are woven together in a rich, dynamic tapestry.</p><h3>St. Augustine's Restless Heart</h3><p>In his "Confessions," St. Augustine offers a profound meditation on the human condition, capturing the restless yearning of the heart for something beyond itself. He famously writes, "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you." For Augustine, this restlessness is a sign of our deep longing for God, a longing that can only be fulfilled in the intimate embrace of the divine.</p><h3>C.S. Lewis' Weight of Glory</h3><p>In his essay "The Weight of Glory," C.S. Lewis explores the profound significance of human desire and its ultimate fulfillment in God. He suggests that our deepest longings - for beauty, for meaning, for transcendence - are not mere quirks of the human psyche, but are in fact whispers of the divine, echoes of our true homeland in heaven. As Lewis writes, "If we find ourselves with a desire that nothing in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that we were made for another world." His words offer a stirring vision of the human journey, reminding us that we are pilgrims and sojourners in this world, always yearning for the weight of glory that awaits us in the next.</p><h3>The Ignatian Tradition and Discernment</h3><p>The spiritual exercises developed by St. Ignatius of Loyola have profoundly influenced Christian spirituality, particularly in the practice of discernment. Ignatius taught that God's will can be discerned through a careful examination of one's interior life, paying attention to the movements of <strong>consolation</strong> (which draw us closer to God) and <strong>desolation</strong> (which pull us away). For Ignatius, discernment is not a matter of abstract speculation, but a practical tool for aligning one's life with God's purposes. This emphasis on discernment connects well with the idea of thoughtfully distinguishing needs and wants in light of God's will. As we learn to attend to the subtle movements of the Spirit within us, we grow in our ability to discern what truly matters, to order our desires rightly, and to live in a way that reflects our deepest identity as beloved children of God.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>First rule:</p><p>In the persons who go from mortal sin to mortal sin, the enemy is commonly used to propose to them apparent pleasures, making them imagine sensual delights and pleasures in order to hold them more and make them grow in their vices and sins. In these persons the good spirit uses the opposite method, pricking them and biting their consciences through the process of reason.</p><p>Second rule:</p><p><em>In the case of those who go on earnestly striving to cleanse their souls from sin and who seek to rise in the service of God our Lord to greater perfection, the method pursued is the opposite of that mentioned in the first rule.</em></p><p><em>Then it is characteristic of the evil spirit to harass with anxiety, to afflict with sadness, to raise obstacles backed by fallacious reasonings that disturb the soul. Thus he seeks to prevent the soul from advancing.</em></p><p><em>It is characteristic of the good spirit, however, to give courage and strength, consolations, tears, inspirations, and peace. This He does by making all easy, by removing all obstacles so that the soul goes forward in doing good.</em></p></div><h3>Insights from the Past</h3><p>As we navigate this emergent landscape, we can draw wisdom from the great thinkers and mystics of the Christian tradition. From St. Augustine's restless heart to C.S. Lewis' weight of glory, from Hannah Arendt's <a href="https://landingatzion.substack.com/p/the-life-of-the-mind">"banality of evil"</a> to St. Ignatius of Loyola’s spiritual exercises, these voices offer deep insights into the human condition and the transformative power of the gospel. They remind us that the path to authentic faith is often marked by struggle and sacrifice, by a willingness to go against the grain and embrace the narrow way.</p><p>At the heart of this transformative work is the call to rightly order our affections, to direct our desires and longings towards their true end in God. In a world that constantly bombards us with false promises of happiness and fulfillment, the way of Jeshurun invites us to discern between the things that truly matter and the things that are merely passing, to invest our lives in the pursuit of God's kingdom rather than the fleeting pleasures of this world.</p><p>This call to rightly ordered affections is not a call to a joyless asceticism but to a life of true abundance and freedom. As C.S. Lewis reminds us, it is only in surrendering our lives to God that we find our deepest joy and fulfillment. "Give up yourself, and you will find your real self," Lewis writes. "Lose your life and you will save it. Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end: submit with every fibre of your being, and you will find eternal life."</p><p>This call to self-surrender is at the heart of the way of Jeshurun, the path of the upright remnant. It is a call to die to ourselves and our own agendas, to relinquish control and allow God to shape us into the people He has called us to be. It is a call to embrace the way of the cross, the paradoxical path of losing our lives in order to find them.</p><p>Ultimately, reclaiming the divine spark within us is not something we can accomplish through our own efforts. It is the work of God's grace, the transformative power of His Spirit at work within us. As we open ourselves up to this transformative work, as we submit to the often painful process of being stripped down and remade in the image of Christ, we begin to discover our true identity and purpose.</p><h3>Reclaiming the Divine Spark</h3><p>At the core of this emergent vision is a call to reclaim the divine spark within - the imago Dei that is our true identity and our deepest calling. In a world that often reduces human beings to mere consumers or cogs in the machine, the way of Jeshurun reminds us of our inherent dignity and worth as bearers of God's image. It invites us to rightly order our affections, to direct our desires and longings towards their true end in God. As St. Ignatius of Loyola teaches us, this is the path of discernment - the art of attending to the subtle movements of the soul in order to align our lives with God's will.</p><p>This is no easy task. At every turn, we are bombarded with messages that seek to conform us to the pattern of this world, to lull us into complacency and compromise. The siren song of materialism, the allure of status and success, the pressure to fit in and follow the crowd - these are the forces that threaten to drown out the still, small voice of God and divert us from the narrow path of faithfulness.</p><p>In the face of these challenges, the way of Jeshurun calls us to a life of intentional resistance, a willingness to stand against the tide of popular opinion and cultural conformity. It is a call to embrace the paradoxical wisdom of the gospel, the upside-down kingdom where the last shall be first and the humble and meek shall inherit the earth.</p><h3>A Countercultural Community</h3><p>As the Church embraces this emergent calling, it will inevitably find itself at odds with the prevailing culture of our time. In a world that celebrates self-indulgence and instant gratification, the upright remnant is called to a different way of being - a life marked by simplicity, generosity, and self-sacrifice. This is not an easy path, but it is the way of Jesus, the way of the cross. As Dietrich Bonhoeffer reminds us, "When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die." This is the cost of discipleship, the price of authenticity in a world that settles for cheap grace.</p><p>This countercultural posture is rooted in a deep conviction about our true identity and allegiance. As the apostle Paul reminds us in Philippians 3:20, "Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ." For those who walk in the way of Jeshurun, this heavenly citizenship is not an abstract theological concept but a lived reality, a fundamental reorientation of our lives and loyalties.</p><p>Living as a countercultural remnant means embracing a different set of values and priorities than those of the surrounding culture. It means valuing simplicity over excess, generosity over greed, humility over hubris. It means treating others with compassion and respect, even when they differ from us in belief or background. It means being willing to sacrifice our own comfort and convenience for the sake of others, to take up our cross daily and follow in the footsteps of Christ.</p><p>If the emergent Church were to fully embrace the vision of Jeshurun and the call to reclaim the divine spark, it would likely result in a radical reassessment of many aspects of contemporary Christian life. The Church would be challenged to examine every facet of its existence in light of the gospel's call to simplicity, generosity, and self-sacrifice.</p><p>Take the example of razors. In a consumer culture that places a high value on personal grooming and appearance, the use of razors has become a taken-for-granted necessity. But for the emergent Church, the question would be: is this truly a need in light of God's purposes? Does the time, money, and energy spent on shaving serve to draw us closer to God and our neighbor, or does it reflect a conformity to the world's standards of beauty and acceptability?</p><h3>The Emergent Church</h3><p>So what does this mean for the Church in the 21st century? It means embracing a more fluid and dynamic understanding of faith, one that is less bound by institutional structures and more open to the leading of the Spirit. It means creating spaces for authentic community and transformative worship, where people can encounter God in fresh and powerful ways. It means empowering every believer to live out their calling as ministers of reconciliation, as agents of God's love and justice in the world.</p><p>Do we need elaborate, expensive structures to worship God and serve our communities, or could we reimagine church as something more organic, more embedded in the fabric of everyday life?</p><p>Do we need a sharp distinction between "ordained" and "lay" Christians, or could we recover a more egalitarian vision of ministry where every believer is empowered to use their gifts for the building up of the body?</p><p>Do we need the latest sound systems, video projectors, and social media strategies to proclaim the gospel, or could we rediscover the power of simple, face-to-face communion and witness?</p><p>Do we need a thriving industry of Christian books, music, and apparel to express our faith, or could we find more authentic and less commercialized ways of living out our identity in Christ?</p><p>In each of these cases, the emergent Church would be called to discern the difference between true needs and mere wants, between the essentials of the faith and the accretions of culture. This would not necessarily mean a complete rejection of all modern conveniences and comforts, but it would require a willingness to hold everything up to the light of the gospel and to be radically open to the Spirit's leading.</p><p>Ultimately, an emergent Church that fully embraced the way of Jeshurun would likely look very different from much of contemporary Christianity. It would be a Church that is radically simplified, radically generous, and radically committed to living out the love and justice of God in the world. It would be a Church that is less concerned with its own institutional survival and more concerned with bearing witness to the transformative power of the gospel in every aspect of life.</p><p>This is a challenging and even daunting vision, but it is also a deeply hopeful one. It invites us to imagine a Church that is truly salt and light in the world, a Church that radiates the beauty and holiness of God in every dimension of its existence. And it reminds us that the path to authentic faith and witness is not always easy or comfortable, but it is the path to which we are called as followers of Jesus.</p><h3>A Light to the Nations</h3><p>Ultimately, the emergent Church is called to be a light to the nations - a countercultural community that bears witness to the transformative power of the gospel. In a world that is hungry for meaning and purpose, the upright remnant points beyond itself to the One in whom all things hold together. As we reclaim the divine spark and walk in the way of Jeshurun, we become signposts of the coming kingdom, living parables of God's redemptive work in the world.</p><h3>The Promise and the Challenge</h3><p>This is the glorious promise and the daunting challenge of the emergent Church. It is a call to radical hope in the face of a world that groans for redemption. It is a summons to bear witness to the truth of the gospel, even when that truth is unwelcome or misunderstood. It is an invitation to join in the great dance of God's redemptive work, to be co-laborers with Christ in the renewal of all things.</p><p>Instead of a one-way transmission of information from pulpit to pew, the emergent Church could explore more dialogical and interactive forms of preaching and teaching, where all members are invited to contribute their insights and experiences.</p><p>Rather than a preoccupation with musical genres and performance quality, the emergent Church could prioritize authentic, heartfelt expressions of praise and prayer, with a focus on participation rather than spectatorship.</p><p>Moving beyond hierarchical models of authority and decision-making, the emergent Church could embrace more collaborative and consensual forms of leadership, with a focus on discerning the Spirit's movement within the whole community.</p><p>Rather than a primary focus on Sunday morning attendance and programmatic involvement, the emergent Church could prioritize more organic and relational forms of discipleship, such as mentoring, small groups, and shared practices of prayer and service.</p><p>Instead of a posture of separation or judgment towards the wider world, the emergent Church could seek to be deeply embedded in the life of its local community, partnering with others to work for justice, compassion, and the common good.</p><p>Moving beyond a primary emphasis on doctrinal instruction and behavioral compliance, the emergent Church could prioritize the cultivation of spiritual practices and disciplines that help members grow in their intimacy with God and their capacity for Christlike love and service.</p><p>Rather than a posture of exclusivity or superiority, the emergent Church could engage in humble and respectful dialogue with people of other faiths, seeking both to learn from their wisdom and bear witness to the unique truth of Christ in a pluralistic world.</p><p>Recognizing the inherent goodness of God's creation and our responsibility to care for it, the emergent Church could be a leader in environmental activism and sustainability, modeling a way of life that honors the earth and its resources.</p><p>While respecting the rich traditions of the past, the emergent Church could also be open to creating new liturgical forms and practices that speak to the needs and aspirations of contemporary people, drawing on the arts, sciences, and cultural resources of our time.</p><p>For the average lay Christian who may feel disengaged or disconnected from the Church service, these kinds of changes could be deeply invigorating and empowering. A reinvigorated Church would invite all members to bring their whole selves into the community of faith - their questions and doubts, their gifts and struggles, their hopes and dreams. It would be a Church where every person is seen as a vital member of the body of Christ, with a unique role to play in God's redemptive mission.</p><p>In this kind of Church, the Sunday bulletin would not be a script to be followed passively, but a springboard for active participation and creative engagement. The liturgy would not be a rote recitation, but a lively and transformative encounter with the living God. And the mission of the Church would not be a burdensome duty, but a joyful privilege - an invitation to join in the great dance of God's love and grace in the world.</p><p>Ultimately, a reinvigorated, emergent Church would be a community of deep belonging, bold imagination, and transformative practice - a sign and foretaste of the kingdom of God in our midst. It would be a Church that dares to dream big, to love wildly, and to follow Jesus wherever he may lead. And it would be a Church where every member is called and empowered to reclaim the divine spark within them and to live out their baptismal vocation with courage and creativity.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>As we step into this emergent future, let us do so with faith and courage, knowing that we are not alone on this journey. We are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, a lineage of faithful men and women who have walked this path before us. And we are held fast by the love of God, who empowers us by His Spirit to live lives of transformative grace and truth. May we rise up as Jeshurun, the upright remnant, and may we shine like stars in the midst of a “crooked and perverse generation”. May we be a people who reclaim the divine spark, who walk in the way of Jesus, and who bear witness to the hope and healing that are found in Him alone. This is our calling, this is our mission, and this is our gift to a world that desperately needs the transformative power of the gospel.</p>
