The work concerns the structure of society and legitimate government, and is regarded as one of the earliest and most influential examples of social contract theory. Written during the English Civil War (1642–1651), it argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign. Hobbes wrote that civil war and the brute situation of a state of nature ("the war of all against all") could be avoided only by a strong, undivided government.  — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(Hobbes_book)">Wikipedia</a></p><h2>1. The Need for Government: Insights from Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan</h2><div class="pullquote"><p>"Hereby it is manifest that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and such a war as is of every man against every man... In such condition there is no place for industry... no arts, no letters, no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."</p></div><p>In his seminal work Leviathan, the 17th-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes presents a provocative and compelling case for the necessity of government. His central argument is that without a strong central authority to keep people's natural impulses in check, human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."</p><p>Hobbes paints a grim picture of what he calls the "state of nature" - the condition of mankind without government. In this state, he argues, there would be "no place for industry... no arts, no letters, no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death." He sees unrestrained human nature as inherently prone to conflict, competition and violence.</p><p>As Hobbes elaborates, "It may seem strange to some man, that has not well weighed these things, that Nature should thus dissociate, and render men apt to invade and destroy one another; and he may therefore, not trusting to this inference made from the passions, desire perhaps to have the same confirmed by experience." But Hobbes finds ample evidence from both history and his own time to confirm this dim view. He points to the brutality and insecurity in places lacking stable government as an empirical confirmation.</p><p>Given this bleak state of affairs, Hobbes argues that the only solution is a social contract where people surrender their natural liberty to an absolute sovereign. As he states: "A man must consider what loss is the nature of sovereignty, whether monarchical or democratic, the act of Our Submission is always the same; which Essentially is this, That every man in particular contracts to submit their will to the will of one man or an assembly of men."</p><p>Only such a sovereign, with the power to make and enforce laws, punish transgressors, and protect the people, can ensure the peace and security necessary for human flourishing. "The final cause, end, or design of men (who naturally love liberty, and dominion over others) in the introduction of that restraint upon themselves, in which we see them live in Commonwealths, is the foresight of their own preservation."</p><p>Hobbes' conclusion, while sobering, is difficult to refute entirely. When we look around the world, it is hard to miss the correlation between weak, unstable or absent government and human suffering, poverty and insecurity. From failed states to frontier regions, zones of anarchy are rarely happy places.</p><p>Of course, Hobbes' prescription of absolute sovereignty would be unpalatable to modern liberal sensibilities. We generally prefer governments restrained by rule of law, individual rights, and mechanisms of accountability. But even liberal democracy is still a form of Leviathan - a powerful central authority that keeps the peace and enables cooperation.</p><p>Hobbes reminds us not to take this for granted - that government, while imperfect, beats the alternative. He challenges us to remember the essential role of the state in safeguarding the most basic human goods of life, liberty and happiness that we hold dear. For even if we reject his specific solution, Hobbes identifies a fundamental problem that every society must solve - in his words "that miserable condition of war, which is necessarily consequent to the natural passions of men, when there is no visible power to keep them in awe."</p><h2>2. Hobbes on the Laws of Nature: Reason, not Revelation</h2><div class="pullquote"><p>“These dictates of reason men used to call by the name of laws, but improperly: for they are but conclusions or theorems concerning what conduceth to the conservation and defence of themselves... therefore the true doctrine of the laws of nature is the true moral philosophy."</p></div><p>In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes offers a strikingly modern and rationalist account of the laws of nature that govern human behavior and politics. Breaking with much medieval Christian thought, Hobbes grounds these laws not in divine revelation or religious authority, but in human reason and the mutual agreements or "theorems" necessary for peace and self-preservation.</p><p>As Hobbes boldly states, "These dictates of reason men used to call by the name of laws, but improperly: for they are but conclusions or theorems concerning what conduceth to the conservation and defence of themselves... therefore the true doctrine of the laws of nature is the true moral philosophy." With this declaration, Hobbes shifts the foundation of moral and political philosophy from the heavens to the earth, from God to man.</p><p>For Hobbes, the fundamental law of nature is "to seek peace, and follow it" because peace is necessary for self-preservation, which is the most basic human good and right. From this, he derives other laws or precepts of reason such as justice, gratitude, modesty, equity, and mercy. But crucially, Hobbes insists that these are binding "in foro interno" (in the inner court of conscience) but not always "in foro externo" (in external action) unless there is a strong sovereign power to enforce them and guarantee reciprocal obedience from others.</p><p>This is because, as Hobbes observes, "He that should be modest, and tractable, and perform all he promises, in such time, and place, where no man else should do so, should but make himself a prey to others, and procure his own certain ruin." In other words, the laws of nature are rational precepts but not always prudent to follow unilaterally unless everyone else is following them too. That requires a social contract and a sovereign power to enforce it.</p><p>Hobbes' account marks an important break with more traditionally religious conceptions of natural law as derived from eternal, divine law knowable through revelation and religious teaching. In the Christian tradition, thinkers like Thomas Aquinas argued for a hierarchy of eternal &gt; divine &gt; natural &gt; human laws, where the higher levels guided and constrained the lower ones. Human laws were just only insofar as they conformed to natural and divine law.</p><p>Hobbes, in contrast, derives the authority of natural law from reason and utility, not divine origins. He is also more circumspect about the motivational power of natural law in the absence of worldly enforcement mechanisms. For "the kingdom of God is gotten by violence: but what if it could be gotten by unjust violence? Were it against reason so to get it, when it is impossible to receive hurt by it?"</p><p>This realist bent would be developed by later thinkers like John Locke and David Hume. They too grounded morality and politics in reason, human nature, and the practical requirements of social cooperation rather than religious diktat. Along with Hobbes, they helped lay the foundations of modern liberalism and social contract theory.</p><p>Of course, these ideas remain controversial, especially in religious circles. Many continue to insist that morality and law must have a transcendent, religious foundation to be valid and binding. And Hobbes' Machiavellian streak can be disquieting. But his core insight remains powerful - at the end of the day, the moral and political order must serve basic human needs and be justified to human reason, not merely asserted on divine authority. The laws of nature and nations alike must prove their worth in their utility for human flourishing and peaceful cooperation.</p><h2>3. Hobbes on the Natural Origins of Pagan Religion</h2><div class="pullquote"><p>"From this ignorance of how to distinguish dreams, and other strong fancies, from vision and sense, did arise the greatest part of the religion of the Gentiles in time past, that worshipped satyrs, fauns, nymphs, and the like; and now-a-days the opinion that rude people have of fairies, ghosts, and goblins, and of the power of witches."</p></div><p>In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes offers a strikingly modern and naturalistic account of the origins of pagan religious beliefs. Drawing on the emerging scientific worldview of his time, Hobbes analyzes religion as a human phenomenon, arising from natural psychological impulses rather than genuine divine revelation. In the process, he pioneers a new approach to religion that would later be developed by anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists.</p><p>As Hobbes observes, "From this ignorance of how to distinguish dreams, and other strong fancies, from vision and sense, did arise the greatest part of the religion of the Gentiles in time past, that worshipped satyrs, fauns, nymphs, and the like; and now-a-days the opinion that rude people have of fairies, ghosts, and goblins, and of the power of witches."</p><p>In other words, Hobbes sees pagan religious beliefs as arising from a pre-scientific inability to distinguish imagination from reality, dreams from waking perceptions. Without a clear understanding of the natural causes of mental phenomena, people attribute agency and reality to the products of their own minds.</p><p>Hobbes identifies four natural seeds of religion: the belief in invisible powers, the tendency to attribute events to these powers, the ritualized behaviors to appeal to these powers, and the habit of believing what other respected figures say about them. He sees these basic impulses, common across cultures, as giving rise to the myriad of supernatural beings and practices found across the world.</p><p>Importantly, Hobbes does not see these beliefs as inspired by genuine encounters with supernatural realities, but rather as understandable errors and projections of the human mind given the limited knowledge available in pre-scientific cultures. As he elaborates:</p><p>"And for the matter, or substance, of the invisible agents, so fancied, they could not by natural cogitation, fall upon any other concept, but that it was the same with that of the soul of man; and that the soul of man was of the same substance with that which appeareth in a dream to one that sleepeth; or in a looking-glass, to one that is awake; which, men not knowing that such apparitions are nothing else but creatures of the fancy, think to be real and external substances, and therefore call them ghosts; as the Latins called them imagines and umbrae; and thought them spirits, that is, thin aerial bodies, and those invisible agents, which they feared, to be like them, save that they appear, and vanish when they please."</p><p>This passage showcases Hobbes' remarkably modern and psychological approach. He sees religious ideas as mental constructs, not objective realities. And he roots their origins in the natural human tendency to project agency and substance onto mental phenomena like dreams.</p><p>Of course, this approach would be highly controversial in his own time, where most believed that at least some religious ideas (usually their own) were genuine divine revelations, not human imaginings. Hobbes himself seems to grant a special status to Christianity, as founded on real prophecy and miracles rather than natural religion.</p><p>But in analyzing pagan beliefs naturalistically, Hobbes pioneeringly applies the methods of science to religion itself. He takes an outsider's perspective, bracketing questions of ultimate truth to examine religious ideas as human phenomena to be explained. In this, he anticipates later scholars of comparative religion, anthropology, and psychology.</p><p>Sigmund Freud, for instance, would argue that God was a projection of the human father figure, an illusion grounded in wishful thinking rather than reality. Sociologists like Émile Durkheim and Max Weber would examine how religious ideas reflect and support the social structures of the cultures that hold them. Anthropologists like James Frazer would catalog the world's mythologies and rituals to uncover their underlying patterns and origins in the human condition.</p><p>All of these approaches owe an intellectual debt to Hobbes' pathbreaking demystification of religion in Leviathan. By daring to analyze (some) religious ideas critically as natural phenomena, he helped open up a new vista for the scientific study of humanity in all its cultural diversity. Even if many of his specific theories have been superseded, his rationalist and humanist approach to religion remains deeply influential to this day.</p><h2>4. Hobbes on the Dangers of Claimed Divine Revelation</h2><div class="pullquote"><p>"For he that pretends to teach men the way of so great felicity pretends to govern them; that is to say, rule and reign over them; which is a thing that all men naturally desire, and is therefore worthy to be suspected of ambition and imposture; and consequently, ought to be examined and tried by every man before he yield them obedience, unless he have yielded it them already in the institution of a Commonwealth."</p></div><p>In Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes displays a remarkably skeptical and suspicious attitude towards those who claim special divine revelation as the basis for their political and moral authority. Writing in the aftermath of the English Civil War, which was in part a religious conflict between different factions each claiming God on their side, Hobbes was acutely aware of the dangers of such claims when used to justify rebellion against the sovereign.</p><p>As he warns, "For he that pretends to teach men the way of so great felicity pretends to govern them; that is to say, rule and reign over them; which is a thing that all men naturally desire, and is therefore worthy to be suspected of ambition and imposture; and consequently, ought to be examined and tried by every man before he yield them obedience, unless he have yielded it them already in the institution of a Commonwealth."</p><p>In other words, those who claim divine sanction are implicitly claiming the right to rule over others, since God's authority would supersede merely human institutions. But Hobbes sees this as a power grab cloaked in religious language - an attempt to set oneself up as a rival to the civil sovereign. And given the natural human desire for power and dominion, he thinks such claims should be treated with great suspicion and carefully examined before being accepted.</p><p>This was a radical position in Hobbes' time, when it was widely accepted that religious authorities had a special pipeline to God's will that entitled them to deference and obedience. The idea that their claims should be skeptically interrogated and subordinated to civil authority was a direct challenge to the political power of the church and the more radically Protestant sects.</p><p>Hobbes backs up this suspicion by pointing out the contradictory and self-serving nature of many claimed revelations. As he bitingly observes, "God is also an incomprehensible spirit, yet they have attributed spirit to him. Spirit means either a subtle, fluid, invisible body, or a ghost, or some other idol or phantasm of the imagination... God is also said to be spirit by the Latins, and so the Holy Ghost is also said to be a dove, a fiery tongue, and to have been sent down upon Christ in the shape of a dove, and upon the apostles in the shape of cloven tongues."</p><p>In other words, people's alleged revelations often suspiciously resemble their own culturally-conditioned imaginings and serve to bolster their preferred religious factions. The very diversity and rivalry of these claims undermines their credibility in Hobbes' eyes.</p><p>Moreover, Hobbes argues that even genuine prophecy does not grant any right to rule or command others politically. As he notes, "After Moses, there was never any prophet that justified his doctrine by miracles, nor was there any authority that a prophet was to be obeyed in all he should command, more than to keep the law of Moses; no, not the Messiah himself, as long as he lived on earth."</p><p>Only Christ the king has the right to rule absolutely, and he did not delegate that right to any earthly religious authorities. Their role is to teach and persuade, not to command and punish, which is the sovereign's prerogative alone. Anyone who claims otherwise is a usurper and a rebel against the rightful civil authority.</p><p>This is a recurring theme throughout Leviathan - the necessity of a unified and absolute civil power to keep the peace and prevent the conflicts that arise from competing claims to divine authority. For Hobbes, religion must be subordinated to the state, not vice versa, or else it will be a constant source of instability and war.</p><p>This position would influence later Enlightenment thinkers like Spinoza and Locke, who similarly argued for religious toleration and the separation of church and state on civil grounds, while maintaining a skeptical attitude towards special claims of revelation that threatened political stability. It is a key plank in the construction of modern liberal secularism.</p><p>Of course, this view remains highly controversial among those who believe that religious truth-claims can and should have direct political implications, and that divine law trumps human law. But Hobbes' warning about the dangers of such views, and his insistence on testing them critically, remains salutary. In an age of competing fundamentalisms, his skepticism towards those who would claim divine right to rule is as relevant as ever.</p><h2>5. Hobbes on the Unity of Spiritual and Temporal Authority</h2><div class="pullquote"><p>"It is true that God is king of all the earth; yet may He be king of a peculiar and chosen nation. For there is no more incongruity therein than that he that hath the general command of the whole army should have withal a peculiar regiment or company of his own. God is king of all the earth by His power, but of His chosen people, He is king by covenant."</p></div><p>One of the most controversial aspects of Thomas Hobbes' political theory in Leviathan is his insistence on the necessity of uniting spiritual and temporal authority under a single sovereign power. In Hobbes' view, the division of authority between church and state is a recipe for conflict and instability, as each side jockeys for supremacy and claims divine sanction for its actions.</p><p>As he puts it, "It is true that God is king of all the earth; yet may He be king of a peculiar and chosen nation. For there is no more incongruity therein than that he that hath the general command of the whole army should have withal a peculiar regiment or company of his own. God is king of all the earth by His power, but of His chosen people, He is king by covenant."</p><p>In other words, while God is the ultimate sovereign over all, he exercises that authority through earthly rulers who have both spiritual and temporal jurisdiction. Just as a general commands the whole army but also has his own specific regiment, so the sovereign has general authority over the commonwealth but also specific authority over religious matters.</p><p>For Hobbes, this unity is essential to preserving peace and preventing the kind of religious conflicts that had torn Europe apart in the previous century. If the church is allowed to have its own separate authority, backed up by claims of divine right, it will inevitably come into conflict with the civil power, leading to chaos and war.</p><p>As he argues, "If a man consider the original of this great ecclesiastical dominion, he will easily perceive that the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased Roman Empire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof. For so did the Papacy start up on a sudden out of the ruins of that heathen power."</p><p>Here Hobbes is referring to the medieval doctrine of the "two swords" - the idea that the Pope wielded spiritual authority while the Emperor wielded temporal authority, with the former ultimately trumping the latter. For Hobbes, this is a dangerous fiction, a relic of the Roman Empire that threatens to undermine the stability of modern states.</p><p>Instead, he argues that the sovereign must have "the whole power of prescribing the rules whereby every man may know what goods he may enjoy, and what actions he may do, without being molested by any of his fellow subjects; and this is it men call propriety. For before constitution of sovereign power, as hath already been shown, all men had right to all things, which necessarily causeth war."</p><p>In other words, it is the sovereign's job to determine the rules of property and justice that prevent conflict and allow for peaceful coexistence. And this includes the rules governing religious practice and belief. The sovereign must have the power to determine what counts as orthodox doctrine and to punish heresy and dissent.</p><p>This is a bitter pill for those who believe in the autonomy and integrity of religious authority. It seems to subordinate sacred truth to political expediency and give the sovereign dangerous power over the conscience. Hobbes anticipates this objection, but bites the bullet, arguing that it is better to have a single acknowledged authority than to have multiple competing ones.</p><p>As he puts it, "There ought either to be one chief commander, that is absolute in both spiritual and temporal, or else the commonwealth must needs be divided into two commonwealths, spiritual and temporal. In which case, into whatsoever miseries they fall that make the division, the sovereign cannot be charged with injustice. Because in suffering this division, he does no more than suffer his own right to be taken from him by rebellion of his own subjects against their own consciences."</p><p>In other words, allowing church and state to be divided is itself an injustice against the sovereign's rightful authority. If conflict results, it is the fault of those who rebelled against that unified power, not of the sovereign who rightly claimed it.</p><p>Of course, this view would be anathema to later advocates of religious liberty and the separation of church and state. John Locke, for instance, would argue that the care of each person's soul must be left to themselves, and that civil authority should have no power to coerce religious conformity or punish dissent.</p><p>The American founders, steeped in this Lockean tradition, enshrined the separation of church and state in the First Amendment to the Constitution. And the Catholic Church itself, in documents like the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom, would come to affirm the autonomy of the spiritual and temporal spheres (while still insisting on their cooperation for the common good).</p><p>Yet Hobbes' challenge remains a serious one. He forces us to grapple with the tensions and conflicts that can arise when ultimate religious commitments and earthly political necessities diverge. And he reminds us of the importance of having a single, coherent source of legal authority to prevent a war of all against all.</p><p>While his proposed solution of absolute sovereignty over spiritual and temporal affairs is no longer tenable, his diagnosis of the problem remains pressing. In a pluralistic world of deep religious disagreements, the question of how to reconcile democratic freedom with stable governance is as urgent as ever. Hobbes may not have the answers, but he clarifies the stakes of the question in a provocative and profound way.</p><h4><em>Stay tuned for Part II, III, and IV, containing insights numbered 6 through 20.</em></h4>
