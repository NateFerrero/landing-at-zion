<h5>I reflected on this question, and from my Christian perspective wrote (abbreviated):</h5><p>"Jesus is divine because he is the living word that emanates from the mouth of the Father, having existed eternally with the Father. But we shouldn't praise the Word, but the Source of that Word. For when a Word goes out of a man's mouth, the word did not act of its own accord, but was generated by the man."</p><h5>Google Gemini says:</h5><p>The central tenet of this view is that Jesus is divine, but this divinity is a reflection of the Father, who is the single, ultimate object of worship. Jesus is the eternal, living Word of God, a perfect and complete expression of the Father's will and nature. However, just as a word spoken by a person is not the person themselves, Jesus as the "Word" is not the Father, the "Source." Therefore, while Jesus is the physical manifestation of God's divinity on Earth, worship should be directed to the transcendent and unmanifested God the Father, who is the source of all things, including the Word.</p><h3>Biblical References</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Jesus as the Logos (the Word):</strong> The Gospel of John is the foundational text for this idea. John 1:1-3 states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made." This passage establishes the pre-existence and divine nature of the Word. The Gospel later identifies this Word as Jesus: "The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us" (John 1:14). This shows that Jesus is not just a man, but the divine Word of God incarnate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jesus's Subordination to the Father:</strong> Despite his divine nature, Jesus consistently points to the Father as the ultimate authority. In John 14:28, he says, "The Father is greater than I." He also frequently prays to the Father (Luke 22:41-42), demonstrating a clear distinction in roles and a relationship of obedience. This supports the idea that the Father is the ultimate "Source" and the proper recipient of worship.</p></li><li><p><strong>Praising the Father through the Son:</strong> Passages like John 14:9, where Jesus says, "Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father," can be interpreted in this context. Seeing and praising Jesus is, in a sense, seeing and praising the Father's Word, which is a perfect representation of the Father's nature. However, the worship is ultimately directed to the source of that nature.</p></li></ul><h3>Quranic References</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Jesus as "A Word from Him":</strong> The Quran also refers to Jesus (Isa) by a similar title, "a Word from Him" (kalimatun minhu). The Quran says of Mary, "She said, 'My Lord! How shall I have a child when no man has touched me?' [The angel] said, 'Thus it is: Allah creates what He wills. When He has decreed a matter, He only says to it, 'Be!' and it is. And He will teach him the Scripture and wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel'" (Surah Al 'Imran, 3:47-48). This emphasizes that Jesus's miraculous creation was a result of God's direct, creative "word."</p></li><li><p><strong>The Rejection of Sonship and Trinity:</strong> The Quran forcefully rejects the idea that Jesus is the "Son of God" in a physical or divine sense, and it warns against the doctrine of the Trinity. Surah An-Nisa, 4:171, states, "O People of the Scripture! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah and His Word which He cast into Mary and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, 'Three.' Desist, it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God." This passage affirms Jesus's identity as the "Word of Allah" but uses it to underscore his role as a messenger, created by God's command, and not as a co-equal part of a trinity.</p></li></ul><h3>Summary of the Synthesized View</h3><p>This synthesized view holds that <strong>Jesus is the divine Word of God (Logos), eternally existing with the Father.</strong> His divinity is a perfect reflection of the Father's nature. However, worship is not to be directed at the Word (the emanation) but at the <strong>Source of the Word (the Father).</strong> Thomas's exclamation, "My Lord and my God," is therefore a recognition of the divine power of the Father made manifest in the "mortal vessel" of Jesus. It is a moment of awe and recognition of God's creative and salvific power, with the praise ultimately directed to the ultimate, unseen Source of all divinity. This perspective allows for the affirmation of Jesus's unique and divine nature, as described in the Bible, while maintaining the strict monotheism and the sole worship of God the Father, as emphasized in both the Quran and Jesus's own teachings.</p>
