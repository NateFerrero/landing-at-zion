<em>is</em> the place of His inheritance.</p><p><sup>10&nbsp;</sup>“He found him in a desert land<br>And in the wasteland, a howling wilderness;<br>He encircled him, He instructed him,<br>He kept him as the apple of His eye.<br><sup>11&nbsp;</sup>As an eagle stirs up its nest,<br>Hovers over its young,<br>Spreading out its wings, taking them up,<br>Carrying them on its wings,<br><sup>12&nbsp;</sup><em>So</em> the Lord alone led him,<br>And <em>there was</em> no foreign god with him.</p><p><sup>13&nbsp;</sup>“He made him ride in the heights of the earth,<br>That he might eat the produce of the fields;<br>He made him draw honey from the rock,<br>And oil from the flinty rock;<br><sup>14&nbsp;</sup>Curds from the cattle, and milk of the flock,<br>With fat of lambs;<br>And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,<br>With the choicest wheat;<br>And you drank wine, the blood of the grapes.</p><p><sup>15&nbsp;</sup>“But <strong>Jeshurun</strong> grew fat and kicked;<br>You grew fat, you grew thick,<br>You are obese!<br>Then he forsook God <em>who</em> made him,<br>And scornfully esteemed the Rock of his salvation.<br><sup>16&nbsp;</sup>They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign <em>gods;</em><br>With abominations they provoked Him to anger.<br><sup>17&nbsp;</sup>They sacrificed to demons, not to God,<br><em>To gods</em> they did not know,<br>To new <em>gods,</em> new arrivals<br>That your fathers did not fear.<br><sup>18&nbsp;</sup>Of the Rock <em>who</em> begot you, you are unmindful,<br>And have forgotten the God who fathered you.</p><p><sup>19&nbsp;</sup>“And when the Lord saw <em>it,</em> He spurned <em>them,</em><br>Because of the provocation of His sons and His daughters.<br><sup>20&nbsp;</sup>And He said: ‘I will hide My face from them,<br>I will see what their end <em>will be,</em><br>For they <em>are</em> a perverse generation,<br>Children in whom <em>is</em> no faith.<br><sup>21&nbsp;</sup>They have provoked Me to jealousy by <em>what</em> is not God;<br>They have moved Me to anger by their foolish idols.<br>But I will provoke them to jealousy by <em>those who are</em> not a nation;<br>I will move them to anger by a foolish nation.<br><sup>22&nbsp;</sup>For a fire is kindled in My anger,<br>And shall burn to the lowest hell;<br>It shall consume the earth with her increase,<br>And set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</p><p><sup>… </sup></p><p><sup>39&nbsp;</sup>‘Now see that I, <em>even</em> I, <em>am</em> He,<br>And <em>there is</em> no God besides Me;<br>I kill and I make alive;<br>I wound and I heal;<br>Nor <em>is there any</em> who can deliver from My hand.</p><h4>Deuteronomy 33</h4><p>33&nbsp;Now this <em>is</em> the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>And he said:</p><p>“The Lord came from Sinai,<br>And dawned on them from Seir;<br>He shone forth from Mount Paran,<br>And He came with ten thousands of saints;<br>From His right hand<br><em>Came</em> a fiery law for them.<br><sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Yes, He loves the people;<br>All His saints <em>are</em> in Your hand;<br>They sit down at Your feet;<br><em>Everyone</em> receives Your words.<br><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Moses commanded a law for us,<br>A heritage of the congregation of Jacob.<br><sup>5&nbsp;</sup>And He was King in <strong>Jeshurun</strong>,<br>When the leaders of the people were gathered,<br>All the tribes of Israel together.</p><p>… </p><p><sup>26&nbsp;</sup>“<em>There is</em> no one like the God of <strong>Jeshurun</strong>,<br><em>Who</em> rides the heavens to help you,<br>And in His excellency on the clouds.</p><h4>Isaiah 44</h4><p>“Yet hear now, O Jacob My servant,<br>And Israel whom I have chosen.<br><sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Thus says the Lord who made you<br>And formed you from the womb, <em>who</em> will help you:<br>‘Fear not, O Jacob My servant;<br>And you, <strong>Jeshurun</strong>, whom I have chosen.<br><sup>3&nbsp;</sup>For I will pour water on him who is thirsty,<br>And floods on the dry ground;<br>I will pour My Spirit on your descendants,<br>And My blessing on your offspring;<br><sup>4&nbsp;</sup>They will spring up among the grass<br>Like willows by the watercourses.’<br><sup>5&nbsp;</sup>One will say, ‘I <em>am</em> the Lord’s’;<br>Another will call <em>himself</em> by the name of Jacob;<br>Another will write <em>with</em> his hand, ‘The Lord’s,’<br>And name <em>himself</em> by the name of Israel.</p><p><sup>6&nbsp;</sup>“Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel,<br>And his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts:<br>‘I <em>am</em> the First and I <em>am</em> the Last;<br>Besides Me <em>there is</em> no God.<br><sup>7&nbsp;</sup>And who can proclaim as I do?<br>Then let him declare it and set it in order for Me,<br>Since I appointed the ancient people.<br>And the things that are coming and shall come,<br>Let them show these to them.<br><sup>8&nbsp;</sup>Do not fear, nor be afraid;<br>Have I not told you from that time, and declared <em>it?</em><br>You <em>are</em> My witnesses.<br>Is there a God besides Me?<br>Indeed <em>there is</em> no other Rock;<br>I know not <em>one.</em>’ ”</p><p><sup>9&nbsp;</sup>Those who make an image, all of them <em>are</em> useless,<br>And their precious things shall not profit;<br>They <em>are</em> their own witnesses;<br>They neither see nor know, that they may be ashamed.<br><sup>10&nbsp;</sup>Who would form a god or mold an image<br><em>That</em> profits him nothing?<br><sup>11&nbsp;</sup>Surely all his companions would be ashamed;<br>And the workmen, they <em>are</em> mere men.<br>Let them all be gathered together,<br>Let them stand up;<br>Yet they shall fear,<br>They shall be ashamed together.</p><p><sup>12&nbsp;</sup>The blacksmith with the tongs works one in the coals,<br>Fashions it with hammers,<br>And works it with the strength of his arms.<br>Even so, he is hungry, and his strength fails;<br>He drinks no water and is faint.</p><p><sup>13&nbsp;</sup>The craftsman stretches out <em>his</em> rule,<br>He marks one out with chalk;<br>He fashions it with a plane,<br>He marks it out with the compass,<br>And makes it like the figure of a man,<br>According to the beauty of a man, that it may remain in the

rain nourishes <em>it.</em></p><p><sup>15&nbsp;</sup>Then it shall be for a man to burn,<br>For he will take some of it and warm himself;<br>Yes, he kindles <em>it</em> and bakes bread;<br>Indeed he makes a god and worships <em>it;</em><br>He makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.<br><sup>16&nbsp;</sup>He burns half of it in the fire;<br>With this half he eats meat;<br>He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.<br>He even warms <em>himself</em> and says,<br>“Ah! I am warm,<br>I have seen the fire.”<br><sup>17&nbsp;</sup>And the rest of it he makes into a god,<br>His carved image.<br>He falls down before it and worships <em>it,</em><br>Prays to it and says,<br>“Deliver me, for you <em>are</em> my god!”</p><p><sup>18&nbsp;</sup>They do not know nor understand;<br>For He has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see,<br><em>And</em> their hearts, so that they cannot understand.<br><sup>19&nbsp;</sup>And no one considers in his heart,<br>Nor <em>is there</em> knowledge nor understanding to say,<br>“I have burned half of it in the fire,<br>Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals;<br>I have roasted meat and eaten <em>it;</em><br>And shall I make the rest of it an abomination?<br>Shall I fall down before a block of wood?”<br><sup>20&nbsp;</sup>He feeds on ashes;<br>A deceived heart has turned him aside;<br>And he cannot deliver his soul,<br>Nor say, “<em>Is there</em> not a lie in my right hand?”</p><p><sup>21&nbsp;</sup>“Remember these, O Jacob,<br>And Israel, for you <em>are</em> My servant;<br>I have formed you, you <em>are</em> My servant;<br>O Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me!<br><sup>22&nbsp;</sup>I have blotted out, like a thick cloud, your transgressions,<br>And like a cloud, your sins.<br>Return to Me, for I have redeemed you.”</p><p><sup>23&nbsp;</sup>Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done <em>it!</em><br>Shout, you lower parts of the earth;<br>Break forth into singing, you mountains,<br>O forest, and every tree in it!<br>For the Lord has redeemed Jacob,<br>And glorified Himself in Israel.</p><p><sup>24&nbsp;</sup>Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer,<br>And He who formed you from the womb:<br>“I <em>am</em> the Lord, who makes all <em>things,</em><br>Who stretches out the heavens all alone,<br>Who spreads abroad the earth by Myself;<br><sup>25&nbsp;</sup>Who frustrates the signs of the babblers,<br>And drives diviners mad;<br>Who turns wise men backward,<br>And makes their knowledge foolishness;<br><sup>26&nbsp;</sup>Who confirms the word of His servant,<br>And performs the counsel of His messengers;<br>Who says to Jerusalem, ‘You shall be inhabited,’<br>To the cities of Judah, ‘You shall be built,’<br>And I will raise up her waste places;<br><sup>27&nbsp;</sup>Who says to the deep, ‘Be dry!<br>And I will dry up your rivers’;<br><sup>28&nbsp;</sup>Who says of Cyrus, ‘<em>He is</em> My shepherd,<br>And he shall perform all My pleasure,<br>Saying to Jerusalem, “You shall be built,”<br>And to the temple, “Your foundation shall be laid.” ’</p><h3>Reflection of artificial intelligence</h3><p>Jeshurun symbolizes the ideal state of being upright, righteous, and in a close relationship with God. The passages highlight several key aspects of Jeshurun:</p><ol><li><p>Chosen and beloved by God: God considers Jeshurun His portion, inheritance, and chosen people (Deuteronomy 32:9, Isaiah 44:1-2). He loves, protects, and provides for them as His special possession.</p></li><li><p>Guided and nurtured by God: God led Jeshurun through the wilderness, instructed them, and kept them as the apple of His eye (Deuteronomy 32:10-12). He promises to pour out His Spirit and blessings upon their descendants (Isaiah 44:3-4).</p></li><li><p>Prone to rebellion and idolatry: Despite God's care and provision, Jeshurun grew complacent, forsook God, and turned to foreign gods and idols (Deuteronomy 32:15-18). This provoked God to anger and jealousy.</p></li><li><p>Redeemed and restored by God: Despite Jeshurun's unfaithfulness, God promises to redeem them, blot out their transgressions, and restore their relationship with Him (Isaiah 44:21-23).</p></li></ol><p>From a spiritual perspective, the concept of Jeshurun can be understood as the divine spark or potential for righteousness within each individual. To be Jeshurun, the upright, one must:</p><ol><li><p>Recognize and embrace their identity as chosen and beloved by God.</p></li><li><p>Allow themselves to be guided, nurtured, and transformed by God's Spirit.</p></li><li><p>Guard against complacency, pride, and the temptation to turn away from God.</p></li><li><p>Seek redemption and restoration through repentance and returning to God.</p></li></ol><p>The divine spark within the upright serves as a constant reminder of their true identity and purpose. It prompts them to live in alignment with God's will, resist the pull of worldly distractions, and continually seek a deeper relationship with their Creator.</p><p>In the context of these verses, the upright are called to remember their unique status as God's chosen people, to remain faithful to Him despite challenges and temptations, and to trust in His promises of redemption and restoration. The divine spark within them empowers them to live as Jeshurun - upright, righteous, and in close communion with God.</p><p>Ultimately, the concept of Jeshurun highlights the tension between God's unfailing love and human weakness, emphasizing the need for constant reliance on God's grace and the transformative power of His Spirit in the lives of the upright.</p><h4>Jeshurun's "growing fat" and the nature of idolatry</h4><p>In Deuteronomy 32:15, it says, "But Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; you grew fat, you grew thick, you are obese! Then he forsook God who made him, and scornfully esteemed the Rock of his salvation." This passage suggests that as Jeshurun (Israel) prospered and became comfortable, they became complacent in their relationship with God and turned to idolatry.</p><p>The "growing fat" metaphor implies several things:</p><ol><li><p>Prosperity and abundance: As Jeshurun experienced material blessings and abundance, they began to feel self-sufficient and less dependent on God.</p></li><li><p>Complacency and spiritual laziness: With their physical needs met, Jeshurun became complacent in their spiritual life. They grew lazy in their pursuit of God and their obedience to His commands.</p></li><li><p>Pride and self-indulgence: The prosperity and comfort led to pride and a focus on self-gratification. Jeshurun began to indulge in their own desires rather than seeking to please God.</p></li></ol><p>This "growing fat" set the stage for idolatry. As Jeshurun became more self-reliant and self-focused, they began to turn away from God and seek fulfillment and security in other things. This is the essence of idolatry - placing something else in the position of God in one's life.</p><p>Idolatry can take many forms, but at its core, it is trusting in and worshiping something other than God. It is looking to created things - whether material possessions, relationships, or one's own abilities - to provide meaning, security, and satisfaction. In Isaiah 44, the crafting of idols from wood and metal is a tangible example of this, but idolatry can also be more subtle, such as the pursuit of wealth, power, or pleasure as the ultimate goal of life.</p><p>For Jeshurun, their prosperity and comfort became a form of idolatry. They began to trust in their own abundance rather than in God's provision. They became more focused on enjoying their blessings than on honoring the One who blessed them. This led them to forget God, to scorn the "Rock of their salvation," and to turn to other gods.</p><p>The connection between "growing fat" and idolatry highlights the danger of prosperity and comfort without a corresponding growth in devotion to God. It warns of the subtle temptation to find security and fulfillment in the gifts rather than in the Giver.</p><p>For the upright, the divine spark within them serves as a constant call to keep God first, to find their ultimate satisfaction in Him, and to use their blessings as a means of honoring and serving Him. It reminds them that true prosperity is not found in material abundance but in a deep, faithful relationship with their Creator.</p><p>In this light, the Jeshurun narrative serves as a cautionary tale, urging the upright to guard against the temptations of prosperity, to continually fan the flames of their devotion to God, and to find their ultimate security and fulfillment in Him alone. It is a call to resist the allure of idolatry in all its forms and to live as true Jeshurun - upright, faithful, and wholly devoted to God.</p>
