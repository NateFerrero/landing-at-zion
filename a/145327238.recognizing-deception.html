These might include:</p><ol><li><p>The fruit of our actions: Are our choices and behaviors leading to greater love, compassion, unity, and upliftment for all beings? Or are they creating more division, harm, suffering, and degradation? The Bible tells us that we shall know them by their fruits - the ultimate outcomes and energetic impact of our actions reveal their true alignment.</p></li><li><p>Alignment with universal spiritual principles: Do our beliefs and actions align with timeless principles such as the inherent dignity and worth of all beings, the interconnectedness of all life, the power of unconditional love, the importance of truth and integrity, and the call to be of service to the greater good? If we find ourselves justifying or participating in things that violate these fundamental truths, it's a red flag.</p></li><li><p>The felt sense in our own heart: Beneath the noise of the mind and the pull of the crowd, what does the deepest part of ourselves say? Is there a felt sense of alignment, inspiration and expansiveness - the hallmarks of divine resonance? Or do we feel contracted, uneasy, or out of integrity, even if we can't fully articulate why? Our inner knowing will always guide us truly if we have the courage to listen.</p></li><li><p>Willingness to question and stand alone: Are we open to humbly examining our assumptions and beliefs, even if it means diverging from the dominant view? Are we willing to stand for truth and love even in the face of opposition or ridicule? The adversary relies on blind conformity and the fear of going against the grain to keep us complicit in falsehood. Cultivating discernment and moral courage is key.</p></li><li><p>Fruits of the spirit: Are we embodying and encouraging the "fruits of the spirit" that Paul spoke of - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control? Or are we succumbing to their opposites - hatred, discord, harshness, self-indulgence, etc.? These qualities are a powerful litmus test for the energies we're aligning with, personally and collectively.</p></li><li><p>Reverence for the sacred: Do our culture and institutions honor the sacredness of life in all its forms - the divinity within each being, the beauty and wisdom of the natural world, the mysteries of the spirit? Or do they reduce existence to the purely material, transactional and profane? Recognizing the sacred and seeking to live in harmony with it aligns us with higher truth.</p></li></ol><p>Ultimately, discerning deception is a skill that must be developed through sincere spiritual practice, self-reflection, and courageous engagement with the world. It requires a commitment to seeking truth above all else, even when it's uncomfortable or inconvenient.</p><p>We must be willing to look honestly at our own shadows and blind spots, and to call out falsehood when we see it, even if it means standing apart from the crowd. This is the narrow path that Jesus spoke of - the way of truth and love that leads to liberation.</p><p>At the same time, we must hold ourselves and others with deep compassion, recognizing that we're all susceptible to the Satan's influence and that our ultimate unity in God is greater than any temporary separation.</p>
