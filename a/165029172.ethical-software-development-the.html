There are 7 of them. I wanted to see how each might - loosely - apply to the task of Software Development.</p><h5>âœ¨ Written by Google Gemini (I added section headings); Image by Microsoft Designer</h5><p>Broken software is a universal frustration, a modern-day affliction that can grind productivity to a halt and sour even the simplest of digital interactions. For software developers seeking to alleviate this pervasive issue, we can find surprisingly relevant, albeit loosely inspired, guidance from the ancient ethical framework of the 7 Noahide Laws. These laws, traditionally understood as universal moral principles, can be reinterpreted to offer a unique lens through which to view and improve the craft of software development.</p><p>Here are 7 mitigations for software developers, inspired by these tenets, to help combat the daily frustrations of broken software experiences:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Inspired by "Do Not Worship Idols" (Affirm God's Oneness/Belief in one God):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mitigation: Prioritize User-Centricity &amp; True Value Over Dogma.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> In software, "idols" can be rigid adherence to a specific technology, methodology, or internally-loved feature that doesn't actually serve the user. Developers should instead maintain a singular focus on the end-user's actual needs and the real-world value the software delivers. This means being flexible, questioning assumptions, and ensuring every feature genuinely helps users achieve their goals, rather than blindly following trends or internal preferences.<br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Inspired by "Do Not Curse God" (Do Not Blaspheme):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mitigation: Uphold Foundational Quality &amp; Respect User Trust.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Blasphemy implies a disrespect for a higher power or foundational truth. For developers, this can be equated to releasing software that knowingly disregards the fundamental principles of quality, stability, and security, thereby disrespecting the user's trust and reliance on the software. The mitigation is to commit to a baseline of excellence, ensuring that what is shipped is not knowingly and fundamentally flawed, unstable, or insecure, thus honoring the user's investment of time and confidence.<br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Inspired by "Do Not Murder" (Do Not Shed Innocent Blood):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mitigation: Ensure System Stability &amp; Protect User Data Vigilantly.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> "Murder" in the software context can be seen as actions that destroy user productivity, corrupt or lose their valuable data, or critically compromise their digital safety. Developers must prioritize the creation of robust, stable systems that prevent crashes, data loss, and catastrophic errors. This involves rigorous testing, fault tolerance, and a profound respect for the integrity of user information, treating it as sacrosanct.<br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Inspired by "Do Not Engage in Sexual Immorality" (Maintain Proper Relationships/Boundaries):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mitigation: Practice Ethical Design &amp; Respect User Boundaries.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law concerns itself with proper structures and respecting boundaries. In software, this translates to ethical design practices that respect user autonomy and privacy. Developers should avoid creating "dark patterns" that deceive or manipulate users, be transparent about data collection and usage, and avoid feature creep that leads to bloated, intrusive, or overwhelming software. Maintain clear boundaries regarding what the software does and how it interacts with the user's system and information.<br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Inspired by "Do Not Steal":</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mitigation: Optimize for Performance &amp; Respect User Resources.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Stealing manifests in software as consuming excessive user time through slow performance, draining battery life unnecessarily, hogging system resources (CPU, memory), or even through opaque data consumption. Developers should strive to create efficient, optimized software that respects the user's limited resources. This means lean code, thoughtful architecture, and ensuring the software delivers value without unduly burdening the user's device or time.<br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Inspired by "Do Not Eat Flesh Torn from a Living Animal" (Do Not Be Cruel to Animals):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mitigation: Cultivate Empathy &amp; Design for User Well-being (Minimize User Suffering).</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law emphasizes avoiding unnecessary cruelty and suffering. For software users, suffering often comes from confusing interfaces, unhelpful error messages, illogical workflows, and a general lack of consideration for their experience. Developers should cultivate empathy for the user, investing in intuitive UI/UX, clear communication, and graceful error handling. The goal is to make the software interaction as painless and frustration-free as possible, anticipating user needs and preventing common pain points.<br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Inspired by "Establish Courts of Justice" (Establish a System of Justice/Dinim):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Mitigation: Implement Robust Feedback Loops &amp; Accountable Issue Resolution.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Explanation:</strong> "Courts of Justice" represent a system for fairness, redress, and upholding standards. In software development, this means establishing clear, accessible channels for users to report bugs, provide feedback, and receive support. Internally, it means having transparent processes for tracking issues, prioritizing fixes, and maintaining accountability for software quality. This ensures that user frustrations are heard, addressed, and that the development process continually learns and improves.<br></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p>By considering these loosely adapted principles, software developers can foster a more ethical, user-respectful, and ultimately less frustrating digital world for everyone.</p>
