<h6>âœ¨ Written by Claude.ai</h6><p>John 14:12 is a powerful promise from Jesus to His disciples, and by extension, to all who believe in Him. When viewed through the lens of the <a href="https://landingatzion.substack.com/p/jeshurun">Jeshurun narrative</a> and the dangers of spiritual complacency and idolatry, this verse takes on even greater significance.</p><p>Jesus is essentially saying that those who truly believe in Him, who are wholly devoted to Him and free from the entanglements of idolatry and materialism, will not only do the works that He did but even greater works. This is an astonishing promise that speaks to the incredible potential of a life fully surrendered to God.</p><p>So, what miracles might we open ourselves up to if we were to get our "obesity" (our addiction to materialism and comfort) in check? Here are a few possibilities:</p><ol><li><p>Spiritual awakening and transformation: As we let go of our idols and fully embrace our identity as Jeshurun (the upright), we open ourselves up to a deeper work of God's Spirit in our lives. This could lead to a profound spiritual awakening, a transformation of our character, and a greater capacity to reflect God's love and righteousness to the world.</p></li><li><p>Empowerment for ministry and service: Freed from the weight of materialism and self-indulgence, we would have more time, energy, and resources to devote to God's work. We could see a greater empowerment for ministry, whether that's preaching the gospel, serving the poor and needy, or using our gifts to build up the body of Christ.</p></li><li><p>Miraculous provision and intervention: As we trust in God rather than in our own resources, we could see Him provide and intervene in miraculous ways. This could include financial provision, physical healing, or supernatural breakthroughs in seemingly impossible situations.</p></li><li><p>Revival and societal transformation: If a significant number of believers were to embrace the Jeshurun lifestyle, it could lead to a widespread spiritual revival. As more people live out the reality of Christ in their daily lives, it could have a transformative effect on families, communities, and even entire societies.</p></li><li><p>Greater unity and love within the body of Christ: Materialism and self-focus often breed division and competition. But as we lay down our idols and pursue God together, we could see a greater depth of unity, love, and cooperation among believers. This in itself would be a powerful witness to the world.</p></li></ol><p>Ultimately, the promise of "greater works" in John 14:12 is a call to a life of radical faith and obedience. It's a reminder that the power for these works comes not from ourselves but from God, and that the key to accessing this power is to abide in Christ and to be freed from the entanglements of idolatry.</p><p>For Jeshurun, the upright, this promise is both an invitation and a challenge. It invites us to embrace our true identity, to fan the flames of the divine spark within us, and to step out in faith to do the works of God. At the same time, it challenges us to lay down anything that would hinder us, to keep our hearts pure and undivided, and to trust fully in God's sufficiency.</p><p>As we do this, we open ourselves up to being instruments of God's miraculous power and transforming love in the world. We become conduits of His grace, vessels of His glory, and witnesses to the reality of His kingdom. This is the high calling and the incredible potential of Jeshurun, the upright.</p><p>As we approach the return of Christ, the calling of Jeshurun - to live uprightly, wholly devoted to God, and free from idolatry - becomes increasingly crucial. The Bible indicates that the days before Christ's return will be marked by increased wickedness, deception, and a falling away from true faith (2 Thessalonians 2:3, 1 Timothy 4:1). In this context, the witness of Jeshurun, the upright, will shine even brighter and have an even greater impact.</p><p>Here are some Bible verses that support this idea:</p><ol><li><p>Matthew 24:12-13 - "And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved." In a time of increasing lawlessness and coldness toward God, Jeshurun's persevering love and faithfulness will stand out.</p></li><li><p>Philippians 2:15 - "...that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world." Jeshurun is called to shine as lights in a dark world, and this will be especially needed in the days before Christ's return.</p></li><li><p>Revelation 3:8 - "I know your works. See, I have set before you an open door, and no one can shut it; for you have a little strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name." This verse is part of Jesus' message to the faithful church in Philadelphia, commending them for their faithfulness despite their weakness. In the same way, Jeshurun's steadfast commitment to God's word and name will be a powerful testimony in the end times.</p></li><li><p>Joel 2:28-29 - "And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. And also on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days." This prophecy, partially fulfilled at Pentecost, also points to a great outpouring of God's Spirit in the last days. Jeshurun, living in the fullness of the Spirit, will be a key part of this end-times move of God.</p></li><li><p>Isaiah 60:1-2 - "Arise, shine; for your light has come! And the glory of the Lord is risen upon you. For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and deep darkness the people; but the Lord will arise over you, and His glory will be seen upon you." This prophecy speaks of a time of great darkness in the earth, but also of the glory of God rising upon His people. Jeshurun, reflecting this glory, will arise and shine in the midst of the darkness.</p></li></ol><p>In this light, the calling of Jeshurun in the days before Christ's return is to:</p><ol><li><p>Stand firm in faith and love, even as wickedness increases.</p></li><li><p>Shine as lights in a dark world, reflecting God's righteousness and truth.</p></li><li><p>Remain faithful to God's word and name, despite opposition or persecution.</p></li><li><p>Be vessels of God's Spirit, participating in His end-times work.</p></li><li><p>Arise and shine with God's glory, even in the face of great darkness.</p></li></ol><p>As Jeshurun fulfills this calling, they will be a powerful witness to the reality of God, a source of light and hope in a darkening world, and a key part of God's plan for the end times. Their lives will testify to the power of God to keep and transform His people, and their faithfulness will pave the way for the return of Christ and the establishment of His kingdom on earth.</p>
