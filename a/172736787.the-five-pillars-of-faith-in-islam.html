<h5>✨Gemini AI &amp; human edited</h5><p>The Five Pillars of faith in Islam is a consolidation and structuring of fundamental obligations that are repeatedly commanded and emphasized throughout the Quran. The term "Pillars" itself is primarily a Hadith-based concept, but the duties themselves are clearly and explicitly found in the Quran.</p><p>Here are the best sources in the Quran for each of the five pillars, with a focus on their direct command and the foundational premise of each:</p><h3>1. Shahada (Declaration of Faith)</h3><p>The Shahada, or the twin declarations of faith, is the cornerstone of Islam. The Quran repeatedly emphasizes the first part—the oneness of God (<em>Tawhid</em>)—which is the central message of the entire scripture.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Oneness of God (First part of the Shahada):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Quran 3:18:</strong> "Allah bears witness that there is no god but He, and so do the angels and those who have knowledge, upholding justice. There is no god but He, the Almighty, the Wise." This verse is often cited as a direct, divine affirmation of the core principle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 47:19:</strong> "So know that there is no god but Allah, and ask for forgiveness for your sin..." This verse directly commands the believer to <em>know</em> the truth of monotheism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 2:163:</strong> "And your God is one God. There is no god but He, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful." This verse states the absolute oneness of God.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Prophethood of Muhammad (Second part of the Shahada):</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Quran 48:29:</strong> "Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." This is a direct and explicit statement affirming the second part of the Shahada.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 3:144:</strong> "Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed [many] messengers have passed away before him." This verse clarifies his role as a messenger, not a divine being.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>2. Salat (Prayer)</h3><p>The command to establish regular prayer is mentioned more than any other pillar in the Quran. It is presented as a fundamental duty for believers.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Quran 2:43:</strong> "And establish prayer and give Zakat and bow with those who bow [in worship and obedience]." This is one of many verses that pair the command for prayer with that of charity, underscoring their joint importance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 29:45:</strong> "Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do." This verse highlights the spiritual purpose of prayer—to purify oneself and remember God.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 4:103:</strong> "And when you have completed the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides. But when you become secure, re-establish [regular] prayer. Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a timed ordinance." This verse emphasizes that prayer is a timed, obligatory duty.</p></li></ul><h3>3. Zakat (Charity)</h3><p>The obligation to give Zakat is consistently mentioned alongside prayer, indicating its importance as a social and economic duty.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Quran 2:110:</strong> "And establish prayer and give Zakat, and whatever good you put forth for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah, of what you do, is Seeing." This verse links Zakat directly to gaining reward from God.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 9:60:</strong> "Zakat is for the poor, the needy, those who work to collect it, those whose hearts are to be reconciled, for freeing slaves, for those in debt, for the cause of Allah, and for the wayfarer; a duty ordained by Allah. And Allah is all-knowing and wise." This verse is crucial as it specifically enumerates the eight categories of people who are to receive Zakat, providing a clear and detailed guideline for its distribution.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 30:39:</strong> "And whatever you give in usury in order to increase thereby the wealth of people, it will not increase with Allah; but what you give in Zakat desiring the Face of Allah - those are the ones who will have their reward multiplied." This verse draws a stark contrast between usury and Zakat, showing Zakat as a means of spiritual growth and divine blessing.</p></li></ul><h3>4. Sawm (Fasting)</h3><p>The command for fasting is explicitly laid out in the Quran, specifically in Surah Al-Baqarah.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Quran 2:183:</strong> "O you who have believed, fasting has been prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you that you may become righteous." This verse directly commands fasting and explains its purpose: to achieve a state of piety (<em>taqwa</em>).</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 2:185:</strong> "The month of Ramadan [is that] in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then [he should fast] an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship..." This verse specifies that fasting is to be done in the month of Ramadan and provides exemptions for the sick and travelers, demonstrating the practicality and mercy of the law.</p></li></ul><h3>5. Hajj (Pilgrimage)</h3><p>The pilgrimage to Mecca is a clear command in the Quran for those who are able to undertake it.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Quran 3:97:</strong> "In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham. And whoever enters it shall be safe. And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for whoever is able to find thereto a way. But whoever disbelieves - then indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds." This verse makes the Hajj a clear obligation for those who have the means.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 2:196:</strong> "And complete the Hajj and 'Umrah for Allah." This verse commands the completion of the rites of both the major pilgrimage (Hajj) and the minor one ('Umrah) for the sake of God.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quran 22:27:</strong> "And proclaim to the people a pilgrimage; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel from every distant path." This verse commands the Prophet to announce the pilgrimage, reinforcing its importance as a communal and universal act of worship.</p></li></ul>
