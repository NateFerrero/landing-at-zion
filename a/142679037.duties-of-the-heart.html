I will not trouble myself to answer them because my purpose in this book was not to refute those who dispute the fundamentals of our faith. My aim is rather to bring to light what is already fixed in our minds and embedded in our souls of the fundamentals of our religion and the cornerstones of the Torah. When we arouse our minds to ponder them, their truth becomes clear to us inwardly and their lights will illuminate even our exterior. </p><p>The following is an analogy for this: An astrologer entered the courtyard of his friend and divined that there is a hidden treasure in it. He searched for it and found masses of silver that had turned black due to a crust of rust which had formed on it. He took a small portion, scrubbed it with vinegar and salt, washed and polished it until it had regained its original luster, splendor and shine. Afterwards, the owner [of the courtyard] gave orders that the rest of the treasure should be treated so.</p><p>My intent is to do the same with the hidden treasures of the heart, namely, to reveal them, and demonstrate their shining excellence, in order that anyone who wishes to draw close to G-d and cling to Him may do the same.</p><h1>1st duty: Unity</h1><p>After investigating after what is the most necessary of the cornerstones and fundamentals of our religion, we found that the wholehearted acceptance of the unity of G-d is the root and foundation of Judaism. It is the first of the gates of the Torah, and it differentiates between the believer and the heretic. It is the head and front of religious truth, and one who strays from it - will not be able to perform religious deeds and his faith will not endure. </p><p>Because of this, G-d's first words to us at Mount Sinai were: "I am the L-ord your G-d...you shall not have other gods before Me", and later on He exhorted us through His prophet saying: (Shema Yisrael..) <em>"Hear O Israel the L-ord, is our G-d, the L-ord is One"</em> (Deut. 6:4)</p><h1>2nd duty: Examination</h1><p>Since we began in the previous treatise, with the various ways in which the Unity of G-d can be demonstrated so that it shall be wholeheartedly acknowledged, and we found that the examination of the wisdom manifested in the universe is the nearest way to clarify His existence and the clearest path to know His reality.</p><p>What is the examination? Contemplating the marks of the Creator's wisdom manifested in the created things and evaluating these marks according to one's mental capacity.</p><p>For wisdom, though varied in its manifestations in created things, is fundamentally and essentially one - just as the sun is one body, while the appearance of its rays when passing through glasses that are white, dark, red or green, varies and assumes respectively the color of each medium, and just as water with which a park is sprinkled assumes the color of the blooms on which it falls.</p><h1>3rd duty: Service of God</h1><p>When we comprehend in our thoughts on the greatness of the Creator, exalted be He, on His infinite might, wisdom and wealth [i.e. resources]; and then turn our attention to a man's weakness and deficiency, in that he never attains perfection; when we consider his poverty and lack of what he needs to supply his wants and then investigate the numerous benefits and favors which the Creator has bestowed on him; when we reflect that the Creator has created man as he is with deficiencies in his very being - poor and needing for his development all necessities which he can only obtain by exerting himself - this too stems from the Creator's mercy to him, so that he may know himself, examine all his conditions and cleave, under all circumstances, to the service of G-d, and so receive for it the reward of the world to come, for the attainment of which he was created, as we have already set forth in the second treatise of this book - how much indeed then does a human being owe to the blessed Creator, in service, thanksgiving and continuous praise, in view of the demonstration already given of the obligation of praise and gratitude that human beings owe to each other for favors rendered them.</p><p>Arousing man to G-d's service and its various branches are necessary on the following grounds. The understanding and the faculty of perception both instruct on human beings the duty of serving G-d. But between the time when the benefits that man receives and the time when he has sufficient intelligence to realize the services he should render in return for them, a long period intervenes. Hence, it is a duty to arouse human beings to their obligations of deeds and inward faith which make the service of G-d complete, so that a human being should not be without religion up to the time when his mental powers have become fully developed. </p><h1>4th duty: Trust</h1><p>Among them, peace of mind, and trusting in G-d as a servant must trust in his master, because if one does not place his trust in G-d, he will place his trust in something else, and whoever trusts in something other than G-d, the Al-mighty will remove His providence from such a person, and leave him in the hands of the one he trusted, and he will be as it was written: "For My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the spring of living waters, to dig for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that do not hold water" (Yirmiya 2:13), "They exchanged their Glory for the likeness of an ox eating grass" (Tehilim 106:20),"Blessed is the man who trusts in the L-ord; the L-ord shall be his refuge" (Yirmiya 17:7), "Praiseworthy is the man who made the L-ord his trust, and did not turn to the haughty and those who turn to falsehood." (Tehilim 40:5), "Cursed is the man who trusts in man, who makes flesh his strength and whose heart turns away from the L-ord" (Yirmiya 17:5).</p><p>If he places his trust in his wisdom and tactics, physical strength and industriousness - he will toil for nothing, his strength will weaken, and his tactics will fall short of accomplishing his desire, as written "He traps the wise with their own cunning" (Iyov 5:13) , and "I returned and saw under the sun, that the race does not belong to the swift, nor the war to the mighty; neither do the wise have bread, [nor do the understanding have wealth, nor the knowledgeable, favor for time and chance happens to them all]" (Koheles 9:11), and "Young lions suffer want and are hungry, but those who seek the L-ord lack no good" (Tehilim 34:11).</p><h1>5th duty: Devotion</h1><p>What is devotion of actions to G-d? It is the intent in all revealed or hidden acts in the service of G-d, to do them for His Name. To attain His favor only and not to do them to win the favor of other people.</p><p>When they are established in a man's heart, and he clarifies for himself that they are the pillars of his service and the roots of his actions, he will be able to fully devote his actions to G-d, and he will not turn nor hope to anyone else, nor have any other intent in them other than to do His will.</p><p>But for the duties of the heart, there can be no hypocrisy, nor expectation of honor, respect, or praise on account of fulfilling them since other people cannot look into one's heart. Therefore one's intent in fulfilling them is automatically only to the Watcher, namely, the blessed Creator alone, as written "I, the L-rd, search the heart, examine the reins.." (Yirmiya 17:10), and "the hidden things belong to the L-rd our G-d" (Devarim 29:28).</p><h1>6th duty: Submission</h1><p>Since our previous discussion dealt with the duty to devote one's acts wholeheartedly to G-d alone, and arrogance in the acts devoted to G-d was found to seize the person more swiftly than any other potential damager, and that its damage to these acts is exceedingly great, I deemed pressing to follow the discussion with that which will distance arrogance from man, namely, submission.</p><p>And furthermore, because it is clear to us that submission is the root of servant hood, and this trait of submission alone is what separates a servant from the traits of master hood.</p><p>As King David said: "Yours, O L-ord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty [for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O L-ord, and you are exalted as Head above all]" (Divrei hayamim 29:11), and "For who in the heavens can be compared to the L-ord? [Who] among the mighty can be likened to the L-ord?" (Tehilim 89:7).</p><p>Furthermore, it is the nature of this trait (of submission) to distance a man from the grandiose, from presumption, pride, haughtiness, thinking highly of oneself, desire for dominion over others, lust to control everything, coveting what is above one and similar outgrowths of arrogance.</p><h1>7th duty: Repentance</h1><p>Since our preceding discussion dealt with the subject of submission, which is the root and beginning of repentance, I deemed it fit to follow with a clarification of its essential parts and the ways to complete its fulfillment. </p><p>I will start with the obligation and necessity for repentance. For it is already clear to us through reason and scripture that a human being falls short in the fulfilment of his service to the Creator which he is under duty to perform. </p><p>By what we observe of man, his changing nature, his composition of different elements, his opposing natures, his changing moods and emotions, the changing of circumstances which motivate his behavior. All this inevitably causes changes in his actions according to the state he is in, such as from decent to indecent, wicked to righteous, good to evil. For this it was necessary for the torah to restrain him (from evil) and guide him (to good). </p><p>Through scripture: </p><p>Among them, what the verse says: "for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" (Bereishis 8:21), and "the L-ord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually" (Bereishis 6:5), and "a man is born as a wild donkey's colt" (Iyov 11:12), and "Behold, the moon has no brightness"(Iyov 25:5) and "how much less, man, who is a worm, and the son of man, who is but a maggot!" (Iyov 25:6), and "[How then can man be justified with G-d,] or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?" (Iyov 25:4). </p><p>Since we have clarified the reality that man's actions fall short, it was out of Divine grace to man that the Creator gave him the capability of rectifying his mistake and of returning the loss of his service through repentance. G-d encouraged the matter and promised (its effectiveness) through his servants, the prophets. And He expanded the possible excuses (vindications) for the man who went off the path of His service, and promised us that He would accept these excuses from us, and desire in us quickly, even if we rebelled against His word and broke His covenant for a long time as written: "And when a wicked man repents of his wickedness and performs justice and righteousness, he shall live thereby..." (Yechezkel 33:19). </p><h1>8th duty: Examining the Soul</h1><p>Since our previous discussion dealt with the essentials of repentance and its conditions, and making a spiritual accounting was one of those conditions, I saw proper to follow with a clarification of the matter of making an accounting with oneself, because this contains matters to arouse oneself for things beneficial in both worlds, as David, peace be unto him, said: "I reflected on my ways, and turned my feet unto Your testimonies" (Tehilim 119:59).  </p><p>Spiritual account-taking means the deliberation of a man on his torah and worldly affairs between his nefesh (bodily soul/emotional side/will) and his intellect, so that one may know what one has and what one still owes of his duties. (this will be clarified through examples).  </p><p>The prophet (Moshe) has already exhorted us on this in saying: "Know therefore this day, and establish it in your heart that the L-ord he is G-d" (Devarim 4:39), and David, peace be unto him, said: "O taste and see that G-d is good" (Tehilim 34:9), "know the G-d of your father and serve Him.." (Divrei Hayamim 28:9), and "Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding" (Tehilim 32:9). </p><p>It was said of one who did not examine his matters and did not account with himself on them: "None returns it to heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say" (Yeshaya 44:19), and "They remembered not His hand [nor the day when He delivered them from the oppressor]" (Tehilim 78:42), and "Remember the days of old..." (Devarim 32:7), and "I remember the days of old [I meditate on all Your works; I ponder on the work of Your hands]" (Tehilim 143:5), and "I will get my knowledge from afar [and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker]" (Iyov 36:3).  </p><h1>9th duty: Abstinence</h1><p>Abstinence is a term which connotes many matters. The term is commonly used but the true matter is a hidden secret. When the cloak is removed, and the seal is broken - its hidden matter will appear, and its purpose will be revealed. </p><p>The plain meaning of abstinence is to bridle the inner lusts and to refrain from something, that one has the ability and opportunity for due to a reason which obligates this. It is said: "the abstainer is one who has the power but does not use it". </p><p>General abstinence is that which is practiced for the welfare of our bodies and to keep our secular matters in good order. Examples are: the practice of kings in instituting laws of the land, the regimen prescribed by doctors for the healthy or the sick, the practice of every intelligent person to bridle his lusts for food, drink, marital relations, clothing, speech, and his other activities and pleasures. </p><p>Divine wisdom necessitated the testing of the soul [by union] in physical earthen bodies which can grow and gain mass through eating foods suitable for it. G-d then implanted in the souls of human beings a desire for the foods appointed to its body in this world in order to sustain and maintain them during the time of their union. </p><p>G-d also implanted in human beings another power. Through this, a man longs for marital relations, so that a human being should procreate another individual to take his place. The Creator granted him reward for these functions, namely, the pleasure in this. </p><p>G-d instituted on man an inclination which drives him to eat, drink, engage in marital relations, and partake of other pleasures and relaxations, which further the welfare of his body, as written: "also he has set the world in their heart[...that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it is the gift of G-d]" (Koheles 3:11-13). </p><p>But when this inclination predominates over the understanding, and the soul is drawn to it, the man turns to the excesses which bring to his detriment and to the destruction of his body. It is necessary because of this, a measure of abstinence from pleasures and relaxations, in order to balance his tendencies, and that his affairs be in proper order in this world, so that he will be considered praiseworthy in them, as written: "A good man shows favor, and lends: he will guide his affairs with judgment" (Tehilim 112:5). </p><h1>10th duty: Love of God</h1><p>It is proper for you, my brother, that you understand and that you know, that everything we previously mentioned of the duties of the heart and limbs, and the volunteering of the soul, they are all rungs and steps leading to this sublime matter, which is our intent to clarify in this gate. It is also proper for you to know that every duty and every good quality, whether it comes through reason, scripture, or tradition, are all steps and stages by which one ascends to this matter, and it is their ultimate purpose and destination. There is no level above it or after it. </p><p>Therefore, because of this, the prophet (Moshe), peace be upon him, placed it immediately after the unity of G-d, in saying: "Hear, O Israel: The L-ord is our G-d; the L-ord is one; And you shall love the L-ord, your G-d..." (Devarim 6:4), and he exhorted on it, and returned to it many times, as written: "To love the L-ord your G-d, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave to Him" (Devarim 30:20). The meaning of cleaving is: faithful love, and wholehearted devotion, as written: "there is a friend who cleaves closer than a brother"(Mishlei 18:24). </p><p>Frequently the torah places fear of G-d before love of Him, as written "And now, Israel, what does the L-ord your G-d require of you, but to fear the L-ord your G-d, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him" (Devarim 10:12), and it says: "You shall fear the L-ord your G-d; and to Him shall you cling" (Devarim 10:20). It is correct to place fear of G-d before love of G-d because [fear of G-d] is the final purpose and furthest end of abstinence, which in turn is the nearest level approaching the lowest level of love of G-d, and the first gate of its gates, and it is impossible for a man to reach it without preceding fear and fright of G-d. </p><p>And therefore, we have preceded the gate of abstinence, because it is impossible to establish love of G-d in our hearts if the love of this world is established there. But when the heart of the believer is empty from the love of this world and free of its lusts, out of recognition and understanding - the love of the Creator will establish in his heart, and it will be set in his soul according to his yearning to Him, and his recognition of Him, as written: "In the way of Your judgments, O L-ord, have we waited for You [the desire of our soul is to Your Name, and to the remembrance of You]" (Yeshaya 26:8). </p><p>What is love of G-d? It is the longing of the soul - and its turning, on its own, to the Creator, so that it can cleave to His supernal light. For the soul is of an essence which is pure and spiritual, it tends towards spiritual things similar to itself. By nature, it removes itself from what is opposite to its nature, namely the coarse physical bodies. </p><p>When the soul understands His omnipotence, and His infinite greatness, it will kneel down and prostrate before Him, in fear, fright, and awe of His power and greatness, and she will not leave this state until the Creator will reassure her, and quiet her fright and awe - then it will drink from the cup of love of G-d, and will enjoy the bliss of being alone with G-d, devoting herself wholeheartedly to Him, loving Him, putting her trust in Him, and yearning for Him. She will have no other occupation than the occupation of His service, and no musings other than of Him and no thought other than of Him. She will not move any of her limbs except to do something which will gain His favor. She will not unbind her tongue except to recall Him, praise Him, thank Him, and laud Him out of love for Him and out of longing to do His will. If He bestows a benefit on her, she will thank Him. If He brings suffering on her, she will patiently bear it, and will only increase her love for Him and trust in Him, as said about one of the pious who would rise in the middle of the night and say: "My G-d, You have starved me, left me without clothing, and set me in the darkness of night, and I swear by Your might and greatness that if You burn me in fire, I will only increase in love of You and joy in You. This is similar to what Iyov said "Though He slay me, yet will I hope in Him" (Iyov 13:15). </p><p>On this matter the wise man alluded to in saying: "a bundle of myrrh is my beloved unto me, between my breasts he shall rest" (Shir Hashirim 1:13), which our sages expounded this verse saying: "even though my beloved is causing me pain and bitterness like myrrh, 'He rests between my breasts' " (Shabbat 88b) . Similarly the prophet (Moshe) said: "And you shall love the L-ord your G-d with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might" (Devarim 6:5).</p><h1>10 sections: a poem</h1><p>(Unity of G-d) - My son, devote your unique soul wholly to its Rock, when you declare the Unity of the One G-d who formed you. </p><p>(Reflection) - Examine, investigate, and contemplate His wonders, and let understanding and the law of righteousness be your girdle.</p><p>(Service) - Fear G-d, and guard His testimonies and laws always, so that your steps shall not stray.</p><p>(Trust) - Let your heart be confident and assured, trusting in G-d, the Rock, that He will be your help.</p><p>(Devotion) - With a pure heart do His laws for His sake, and exalt no human being in your generation.</p><p>(Submission) - See, that the end of a creature is to the dust, be lowly for sand, and dirt will be your dwelling place.</p><p>(Repentance) - Let the speech of your understanding contend against your folly, and repent from the brazen of your heart and [evil] inclination.</p><p>(Accounting) - The ways of G-d, in just and proper judgment, search with wisdom in your thoughts and inner being.</p><p>(Abstinence) - Remove from your heart the childish and adolescent, and do not desire the desires of your youth</p><p>(Love of G-d) - In your yearning, you will see the face of the everlasting G-d, and your unique soul will commune with your Rock</p><h1>Reflection of artificial intelligence</h1><h5>✨ Written by Claude.ai</h5><p>There are many profound and timeless lessons we can draw from Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart that are just as relevant today as they were nearly 1000 years ago:</p><ul><li><p>Making God the foundation and center of our lives is key. Accepting God's oneness and devoting ourselves wholeheartedly to His service should be our top priority. This provides the moral and spiritual bedrock for building strong, righteous families and societies.</p></li><li><p>Thoughtful reflection on God's wisdom and wonders as manifested in creation can strengthen our recognition of Him. Taking time regularly to contemplate the marvels of the universe draws us closer to our Creator.</p></li><li><p>Genuine service of God must go beyond outward acts to encompass the inner life of the heart - our thoughts, attitudes and intentions. Outward religiosity is hollow without sincere devotion.</p></li><li><p>Placing our trust fully in God, not in human wisdom or strength, keeps us aligned with His will and frees us from ultimately futile dependency on the transient things of this world.</p></li><li><p>Humility and submission before God's greatness are essential postures that deflate human arrogance and ego. Remembering our mortality and smallness relative to God instills healthy perspective.</p></li><li><p>Regular repentance and self-accounting of our deeds and spiritual state keep us on the path of righteousness. We must be willing to honestly examine ourselves and correct our course when needed.</p></li><li><p>Developing authentic love for God by emptying our hearts of worldly desires and filling them with yearning for Him is the pinnacle of religious life. All other spiritual duties lead to and flow from this.</p></li><li><p>Patiently bearing hardships out of love and trust in God builds unshakable faith and profound closeness with Him. Trusting God is good even when life is bitter is the way of deep spirituality.</p></li></ul><p>In summary, Duties of the Heart provides an insightful roadmap for cultivating rich inner spiritual life and orienting our existence around devotion to God. Its teachings on purifying our hearts and making God's service the center of our individual, family and communal lives remain powerfully relevant for building a godly world today. The book reminds us that this must start with each of us doing the inner work of truly knowing, loving and living for God.</p>
